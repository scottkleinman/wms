The term "green entrepreneur" used to be seen as at best an oxymoron, at worst a humanities student's well-meaning but ill-advised foray into business on their gap year, never to be repeated.; Now however entrepreneurs are driving the green agenda. Green industries and sustainable solutions are obvious areas for growth and expansion, and the once fanciful idea of "making money while doing good" is now a reality.; The London Leaders initiative is a great example. Now in its sixth year, the programme is run through the London Sustainable Development Commission (LSDC) with the support of the Mayor of London's office, to help promising green entrepreneurs in the capital through mentoring, training and profile building. Boris Johnson has praised the scheme, saying it "highlights what can be achieved when you combine the creativity of Londoners with a passion for sustainability and volunteering."; In truth, it's not just Londoners that benefit. As the country's biggest city it can be a breeding ground for ideas that spread out across the country and further afield. Of the 70 former London Leaders, successful alumni include Red or Dead brand founder Wayne Hemingway's 'pop up shop', providing free retail space for new creative businesses (2009-10). Also 88-year-old Lotti Henley's 'Plan Zheroes' solution to cut food waste, inspired by her war time experience, included an online map linking providers of surplus food, such hotels and caterers, with local charities and community projects (2011-2012).; The 2013-14 cohort of 12 London Leaders are united by a sharp focus on boosting the local economy through jobs and growth while fundamentally supporting the principles of sustainable development. The ideas intended to start small and grow big this year include a business making bio-fuel out of used coffee, a green enterprise incubator, urban farming solutions from food grown both overground and underground, clothes rental and community solar power co-operatives.; Over the next few weeks Guardian Sustainable Business will profile some of this year's London Leaders, and will report on their progress again at the end of the year to discover both what they have achieved and learn the lessons they hold for the wider sustainability community.; Join the community of sustainability professionals and experts.
