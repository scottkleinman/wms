That would be a tragedy\tI\u2019m one of the lucky ones: severely dyslexic and with a tendency to isolate, my teenage years were marked by regular phone calls to my parents and meetings with teachers. The conversations would usually follow a fairly routine pattern: \u201cTom\u2019s behind with his work\u201d or \u201cTom\u2019s not actually turning up to lessons he doesn\u2019t want to go to.\u201d; My parents would nod and look concerned. Then would come the suggestion: \u201cWe think he\u2019s doing too much drama.\u201d My parents would look confused and reply: \u201cYou do know that it\u2019s drama that keeps him coming to any lessons at all. If you cut the drama he would just stop attending school completely.\u201d; I was lucky because drama was available and well taught at my school, because my parents understood me \u2013 and because they understood what drama could do for me.; My whole education was filtered through the prism of drama and theatre. I learned about history from Shakespeare \u2013 and along the way quite a bit about humanity as well. Studying John Osborne opened my eyes to politics and Joe Orton unlocked a world of queer counterculture. When teachers said: \u201cWe\u2019re worried he\u2019s retreating into a fantasy world; he\u2019s not facing reality,\u201d my parents would have to remind them that for me, theatre was more real than geography \u2013 it wasn\u2019t a fantasy world; it was my reality. As the character of Irwin says in The History Boys: \u201cIt\u2019s no fun teaching the stage struck.\u201d; This isn\u2019t a particularly unusual story; it\u2019s one I share with countless others. I now come across teenagers studying for GCSEs and A Levels on a regular basis. They often have a similar story to mine. I would say 90% of young people I meet who enjoy acting tell me it\u2019s because it improves their confidence. But then our stories diverge; I saw drama as a way of contextualising the world around me; I thought plays could change the world. Many of todays GCSE students simply think theatre can change their mood. It\u2019s not that they aren\u2019t political, bright and articulate; it\u2019s simply that they don\u2019t seem to be connecting their politics and their view on the world with the work they do in drama classes.; Yes art is therapeutic, but it isn\u2019t therapy.; When I ask drama students what they are studying, they often list Stanislavski or Meisner. They\u2019ll talk about the process of acting, but they never talk about what theatre is about. It\u2019s like learning to cook by reading recipe books but never actually cooking or eating the food. So when the artistic director of the National Youth Theatre, Paul Roseby, was reported by the Stage as saying that GCSE drama had become \u201cirrelevant\u201d, I couldn\u2019t help but agree with him. But he then went on to suggest that we should therefore scrap GCSE drama and thread drama into the core curriculum. At this point, I find myself passionately disagreeing with him.; The idea that taking drama off the syllabus will somehow strengthen its worth in schools is as barmy and as cryptic as Alice in Wonderland. Thanks to league tables, schools base almost their entire worth on exams. Teachers will often remind us of the soft lessons learned in schools, but the institution will still make education about the grades.; If you take GCSE drama off the syllabus, it\u2019s unlikely any state funded school will be able to justify keeping specialist drama teachers on the payroll \u2013 and so teaching of drama will fall to English teachers, who are often just not trained or able to teach drama well. Then how do you integrate drama into the core curriculum? How can a Geography teacher be expected to teach using drama? It\u2019s as unreasonable as expecting drama teachers to teach geography.; But there is a more fundamental problem with this argument. Theatre isn\u2019t there to educate. Shakespeare didn\u2019t write the history plays as a teaching aid. Sure, they educate, but they aren\u2019t educational \u2013 that\u2019s not the sole purpose of going to the theatre. By threading drama through the core curriculum, you reduce it to role-playing as a teaching aid. And it\u2019s not like we haven\u2019t tried it before \u201cintegrated teaching\u201d was popular in the 1970s among educationalists, but I\u2019ve never heard of a teacher talk about the experience positively.; The problems with GCSE drama aren\u2019t confined to drama; it\u2019s a problem with GCSEs in general. Ask a leading mathematician or scientist if the GCSE syllabus is relevant and they\u2019ll tell you no. So let\u2019s scrap all GCSEs and start again \u2013 let\u2019s create an holistic education system that genuinely teaches that humanities and sciences are just different ways of exploring the same fundamental questions. But in the process, let\u2019s not reduce drama to a teaching aid.; Thomas Hescott is a theatre director and writer, who you can follow on Twitter @MrThomasHescott; Join our community of arts, culture and creative professionals by signing up free to the Guardian Culture Pros Network.",
