Miracle cures, miracle crops, miracle fuels, miracle financial instruments, miracle profits: the continued enthusiasm for these claims reflects the triumph of hope over experience.; Here\u2019s another one: a miracle technique that allows us to reconcile our insatiable demand for meat with the need to protect the living planet. Better still, it proposes, eating meat could actually save the biosphere. A TED talk which makes this claim has been viewed 2.6m times.; Over the weekend in London, the author of this talk, Allan Savory, convened an international conference, in which a long list of speakers lined up to insist that his methods have been vindicated.; I was intrigued by his TED talk, in which he screened astonishing before-and-after pictures purporting to show the transformative impacts of his technique. Savory maintained that without grazing by livestock, grasslands turn to desert. He claimed that he had reversed desertification by raising the number of cattle and goats by 400%, grazing them intensively for short bursts in small paddocks and then moving them on.; By this means, he said, the hooves of the animals break up what he calls the \u201ccancer of desertification\u201d: the crust of algae that forms on bare soil in dry areas. Breaking it up, he claimed, encourages the growth of grass. By trampling vegetation and coating it with manure, the livestock produce a mulch that ensures the soil absorbs and retains more water.; As a result of this transformation, we can do something astonishing:; Savory\u2019s grazing technique, which he calls \u201cholistic management\u201d, could, in other words, reverse not only desertification but also climate change \u2013 while permitting us to keep consuming vast quantities of meat. No wonder it has been received with such enthusiasm.; I would love to believe him. But I\u2019ve been in this game too long to take anything on trust \u2013 especially simple solutions to complex problems. So I went to the library and started reading. A large number of academic papers have been published in response to his claims, testing them by means of experimental and comparative studies. The conclusion, overwhelmingly, is that his statements are not supported by empirical evidence and experimental work, and that in crucial respects his techniques do more harm than good.; A new review of experimental results, in the journal Agricultural Systems, has this to say about Savory\u2019s claims that his intensive rotational grazing (IRG) can regenerate grassland:; Another review article, in the International Journal of Biodiversity, found that grazing by livestock in arid places is more likely to destroy grass and other vegetation than to protect it:; Among these sites was a ranch in Arizona whose vegetation, Savory had claimed, had become \u201cmoribund\u201d and increasingly sparse since grazing there had ceased. In reality, there has been a massive increase in both plant cover and plant diversity on this site since the livestock were removed.; As for the claim that the algal crust is the \u201ccancer of desertification\u201d, it appears to be just the opposite: a rich, diverse and ancient ecosystem in its own right, that stabilises the soil, increases organic matter and absorbs water. These crusts are \u201cfragile, highly susceptible to trampling, and are slow to recover from trampling impacts. Loss of these crusts results in increased erosion and reduced soil fertility\u201d.; Overall, it concluded: \u201cEcologically, the application of holistic management principles of trampling and intensive foraging are as detrimental to plants, soils, water storage, and plant productivity as are conventional grazing systems.\u201d; So what exactly do Savory\u2019s dramatic pictures of transformation show? As they are uncaptioned and not linked in his presentations to scientific studies, it\u2019s hard to tell. Many factors affect the way vegetation changes in arid places. Do these shifts really depict the results of the application of his techniques, or something else entirely?; As for the claim that holistic management can reverse the build-up of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, according to RealClimate.org, he\u2019s wrong by orders of magnitude. Just to balance current carbon emissions, the uptake of carbon by all the world\u2019s vegetation (not only grasslands) would have to triple. But Savory says he can go beyond that, and his technique can bring atmospheric carbon \u201cback to pre-industrial levels\u201d. As RealClimate puts it: \u201cscience tells us that this claim is simply not reasonable.\u201d; Far from grazing helping to store carbon, holistic management seems to have the opposite effect: the evidence strongly suggests that livestock reduce carbon storage rather than raising it. In terms of total greenhouse gas emissions, the intensive grazing of cattle on grasslands can be even worse than producing them in feedlots.; While Savory was in London, I managed to secure a telephone interview with him, to ask him about these challenges. It did not go well. He began by comparing himself to Galileo, which is never a good sign, and it went downhill from there. I have learnt to be suspicious of people who give long, distracting, irrelevant answers to simple questions. Apart from Ian Plimer, I have never come across anyone who does it to greater effect.; I asked him about that ranch in Arizona, and the claim that he was diametrically wrong about what had happened to the vegetation once grazing had ceased. He launched into a long disquisition about a court case in Namibia. After several attempts I at last managed to break in, to remind him I\u2019d asked about a ranch in Arizona. It was as if he registered the name of the state and nothing else: he started talking about the quality of the state\u2019s scientists, its rifle ranges and its tortoises.; I asked him about his carbon claims. He told me it wasn\u2019t him who had made such claims, but other people who knew far more about it than he did. Could he gave me the names of those people?; He gave me a long, rambling answer about the different impacts of land management around the world, climate change, fire, poverty, violence, red meat and veganism. I tried and tried again. At last I managed to bring him round to the question, and extracted some names from him. So where had they published their calculations? They hadn\u2019t.; His staff later sent me an article on the issue published on the Savory Institute\u2019s website, but - as far as I can tell - nowhere else. There are no named authors. If you intend to make a massive and extraordinary scientific claim, and build your position around it, you had better ensure that it has been properly tested, which is why the peer review process exists.; Broadly, however, his theme was that what scientists were studying was not the entirety of holistic management, but only one aspect of it:; Savory referred me to a paper he\u2019d written, which he said, explains the science and methodology of holistic grazing. This paper (again apparently unpublished except on his website) explained the lack of scientific support for his claims as follows:; It then contended that:; Unfortunately Savory gives no reference for this assessment. In the academic literature, I\u2019ve been unable to find a paper on the subject by anyone called Gill. Elsewhere, all I have been able to locate is a three-page magazine article by Gill, reproduced on Savory\u2019s websites. It contains no references, no data and no links to any experimental or empirical research. If this is \u201cthe only independent assessment of all available critics and their citations\u201d that Savory will accept as valid, I think it might tell you something about the substance of his claims.; It all reminds me, I\u2019m afraid, of the way in which certain evangelists for alternative medicine operate.; For example:; - Savory maintains that it\u2019s not the claims that are wrong but the scientific process by which they are assessed. (In one interview he says: \u201cyou\u2019ll find the scientific method never discovers anything.\u201d); - He claims that \u201creductionist science\u201d doesn\u2019t understand what holistic management involves, which is why it fails to measure the outcomes properly. But, as Adam Merberg points out, his account of what holistic management means appears inconsistent and poorly defined, which \u201callows Savory to blame any failures on a misunderstanding of the method.\u201d; - As scientific studies don\u2019t produce the results he wants, he relies instead on testimonials.; - He diagnoses normal conditions as deadly pathologies (\u201cthe cancer of desertification\u201d) then claims to have found a cure for them.; - He makes claims about his techniques which are not only implausible but appear to be scientifically impossible.; It seems to me that there\u2019s a fairly solid rule, that applies to almost any question: what you want to believe is almost always wrong. If something sounds too good to be true, that\u2019s because, in nearly all cases, it is.; Monbiot.com\n",
