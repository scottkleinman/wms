Supported by the City of Sydney and in partnership with Firth\u2019s production company NewsLab and the Sydney Writers Room, SMOW looked like a project cooked up by some media creatives to take the piss out of the art world.; And so it was: on Tuesday, Firth claimed he had been sacked by his own company for claiming that $30,000 the project had received in funding from an undisclosed arts body was patently absurd because the SMOW was nothing more than a scam; a cover to raise money for the Sydney Writers Room, which doesn\u2019t receive arts funding.; Firth, has form with this kind of cultural hijinks. The Zeppo Marx of The Chaser team, he\u2019s the creator of some occasionally amusing piss takes, but the SMOW idea \u2013 to hang unrelated words on gallery walls and call it a museum \u2013 was really nothing special. As a hard-hitting satire of the art world, it was no big deal either, it had all the hallmarks of people who didn\u2019t know what they were talking about.; For art neophytes, conceptual art is an obvious target since it lacks what most people recognise as craft skill or as possessing some intrinsic artistic value. But text art, a discreet kind of art that has evolved from its roots in the early 20th century art movements such as dadaism and surrealism, puts a high value on the audience's ability to recognise and understand a sophisticated and often satirical communication bereft of frills and bourgeois values of landscape painting and portraiture. The irony here is that Firth and his accomplices appear to misunderstand text art and conceptualism, two types of contemporary art that are in fact their allies.; Where Firth might have done damage is in the realm of arts funding. SMOW approached the Australia Council, Arts NSW, the State Government and the City of Sydney for funding. That they got it, is, Firth says, evidence that the whole arts funding system is rotten. \u201cI think that what this exhibition, more than anything, shows [is] that the arts funding model is broken,\u201d Firth claimed. \u201cIf something as fundamentally stupid as this can get funding from all levels of government then clearly there is something profoundly wrong with arts grants in Australia.\u201d; But what Firth plainly doesn\u2019t understand is his \u201cfundamentally stupid\u201d exhibition is nothing of the sort; there are numerous Australian artists who have staged exhibitions of text works, in painting, drawing, and sculpture. They have serious intentions and are taken seriously by the art world. Artists such as Jon Campbell, Robert MacPherson and Emily Floyd work out of the conceptual and text art tradition and, far from being dilettantes, they have long and substantial careers that demonstrate their serious intentions.; The big difference between Firth and those kinds of artists is that their work is offered in good faith. No matter how much some might believe that conceptual artists are frauds, and that their work is worthless, that it is offered in good faith is the last line of defence against the emperor's new clothes syndrome. Everyone is entitled to their opinion \u2013 no matter how wrong headed or misguided \u2013 but good faith is the protective armour against ignorance and disbelief.; It\u2019s not difficult to satirise the world of art funding \u2013 a peruse through the annual reports of the Australia Council announcing which artists got what money for their projects supplies more than enough material. Plans to build a yurt or to buy a Segway or to stage projects of such little interest that only the artist and their friends will ever likely bother to see it \u2013 all of this stuff just lies in wait for any shock jock or tabloid columnist ready to decry the \"waste\" and \"stupidity\".; Firth has in one move belittled artists everywhere who apply for funding and most likely cruelled his chances of ever receiving a grant again. But there's a bigger point here than just his silliness and muddle-headed reasoning. In the current political climate, with the federal government flagging funding cuts for humanities research and a promise to find \"savings\" wherever possible, there's real threat that arts organisations that are the lifeblood of art-making and exhibition will get the axe. Stunts such as Firth's might give the federal government's razor gang exactly the excuse they're looking for.\n",
