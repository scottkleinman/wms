The study looked at how the efficiency with which we make decisions based on ambiguous sensory information \u2014 such as visual or auditory \u2014 is affected by the potential for, and severity of, anticipated punishment.; \u2022 An archive of documents, photographs and films spanning 150 years of Lincolnshire's engineering history has been preserved for posterity, in a joint project led by the University of Lincoln and Lincolnshire County Council. The Ruston Hornsby (Siemens) Archive contains nationally significant material revealing the central role played by Lincolnshire companies in England's industrial heyday during the 19th and 20th centuries.; \u2022 Researchers from the Royal College of Art's Helen Hamlyn Centre for Design are helping to inform arts strategy at one Scotland's largest hospitals to enhance its mental health unit. The research is part of a wider creative strategy to enhance the clinical environment through visual arts.; \u2022 People with a severe unexplained psychological illness have abnormal activity in the brain, research from the University of Cambridge and UCL shows. \"The processes leading to these disorders are poorly understood and highly variable, said Dr James Rowe from the University of Cambridge. \"As a result, treatments are also complex, often lengthy and in many cases there is poor recovery.\"; \u2022 A gene linked to obesity and over eating may also increase the risk of skin cancer, according to scientists at the University of Leeds. The results suggest that the FTO gene has a more wide-ranging role than previously suspected, with different sections of the gene being involved in various diseases.; \u2022 Researchers from the University of Oxford and Havard University looking to explain how the daffodil got its 'corona' \u2013 a crown-like structure also referred to as the 'trumpet' \u2013 have found that it is not an extension of the petals as previously thought, but is a distinct organ sharing more genetic identity with stamens, the pollen-producing reproductive organs.; Would you like your university's research featured on the network?
