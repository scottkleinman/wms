I tried to make it work	It was always hard to tell what you wanted from me, and the more I twisted myself into knots, the less I seemed to get back • Academics should stop moaning – uni life has many perks • More from our Academics Anonymous series	Dear Academia,; I will claim insincerely that I apologise for sending you a letter, Academia. Everyone says that you're supposed to have these kinds of conversations in person. But it's been difficult to get in touch with you lately, and we just seem unable to connect with each other anymore. I think there was a time when we did – a time when we excited each other, when our presence in each other's lives was positive and inspired dreams about a bright future together that would be challenging and rewarding for both of us.; But that time now seems so far in the past I can barely remember what it was like to enjoy teaching and research feel that way about you. It's been five years now since I received my PhD we began our courtship, and after a couple years working intermittently as an adjunct of flirtation, we I finally got a full-time, non-tenure track position as a visiting assistant professor quasi-serious a couple of years ago.; Your inability to commit to a real relationship should have been a warning sign to switch careers years ago, but I still held on to the hope that our relationship could develop into something more than yet another terminal contract.; I know, everyone says that once the honeymoon is over things get harder, but that you should stay together and eventually the relationship is even better for it. The thing is, Academia, our relationship has never really been able to provide me with an even vaguely satisfactory lifestyle as fulfilling as I hoped it would be.; Early on, when we were first getting to know each other, things seemed bright and hopeful, and I really believed we had a future together. Sure, I knew that getting a job our relationship wouldn't always be easy – especially in the current economy it never is these days, and the situation in the humanities is especially bleak some said that our relationship would be especially challenging – but I sincerely believed that we could make it work.; But from day one, it seems, things never quite worked out right. Almost as soon as I went on the job market our relationship got serious, you were just a major source of stress and crushing self-doubt.; It was always hard to tell what you wanted from me in those job advertisements that run the gamut from impenetrably vague and general to so absurdly specific that they were clearly designed with an inside candidate in mind, and the more I twisted myself into knots to try to give you what you wanted, the less I seemed to get back in return. And now, I've been trying for so long to get a job keep our relationship going, it's hard to remember why we got together in the first place.; Sometimes I remember, and that old flame comes back, and every time it does I think that now things have changed, that things will be different and now we'll be happy together. And yet it never quite happens.; And at this point I can say that I've applied to more jobs than I can count in places I never wanted to live anyway tried everything I can to keep us together. I've put just as much time and energy and borrowed money that is now accruing interest into our relationship (maybe more) as other couples I know.; But they seem so much richer more fulfilled than me – their lives have moved forward, they've gotten promotions and bought houses and had children grown together, and they've been able to do so much together. But us…I feel like we're exactly where we were years ago teaching in yet another temporary position and facing impending unemployment yet again, and I'm tired of telling myself that things will change, that if I just try a little harder that you'll respond in kind.; I've gone out of my way to make you happy – I've published articles in leading journals reached out and shared myself with you. I've been a consistently dedicated teacher thoughtful and attentive to your needs, but you don't even seem to notice or care. Sometimes, it even seems that you prefer partners who regard students as nothing more than annoying impediments to research treat you poorly half the time.; On top of all this, you often seem terribly fickle and inconstant. Sometimes it seems it's more important to you who I know or whose name I can drop or who my adviser was what social circles I travel in, rather than my quality as a scholar and teacher who I am or how we could complement each other.; I used to wonder if I was intelligent good enough for you, but now I know that even though I am, that that doesn't necessarily mean that I will be able to have a job, let alone a career you will make me happy. And I have to tell you, Academia, from what I hear I'm not the only person whom you've made feel this way.; I was ready to commit to you long ago, but you just never seemed willing to commit to me. For years now, the only quality time we spend with each other is when standing faculty in the area are on sabbatical you suddenly discover that you need me or someone has just gotten smart enough to leave academia entirely broken up with you, and those times never last more than a few months at a time.; We've even travelled together I've worked in the US and abroad, but all of my experience working at different universities in different countries our experience together just doesn't seem to mean anything to you.; And now I think that it just may be too late.; I'm tired of trying to make this work for so long and never getting anything back from you like financial stability or job security or even the legitimate hope of a real job. I also know that you've massively increased the hiring of adjuncts at salaries that typically place people below the poverty line left a trail of broken hearts and careless one-night stands in your wake, while the pool of tenure-track positions has shrunk tossing aside potentially fulfilling relationships with good people.; And the administrative bloat caused by the creation of various new administrative positions that have more to do with marketing or public relations and nothing to do with research or pedagogy crowd of people with whom you've lately been spending most of your financial resources time seems to suggest that your priorities no longer reflect a real commitment to good education and scholarship you're not the kind of person I thought you were.; And so, Academia, I think it's time that we part ways. This will be painful for me both of us especially since I have no real job experience outside of academia, I know, and I wish I could say that I bear you no ill will or that I enjoyed our time together. But maybe, at least, if we separate now, I can find a career someone who does make me happy and with whom I can have a real future. I deserve better.; Sincerely,; The Adjunct, also known as the visiting assistant professor, sometimes also called lecturer or occasionally instructor.; Join the Higher Education Network for more comment, analysis and job opportunities, direct to your inbox.
