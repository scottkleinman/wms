Monday 10 March 2014 14.48 EDT	Smithsonian appoints cardiologist David Skorton as new secretary	• President of Cornell will take over in July 2015 • Predecessor Clough ran foul of conservative Republicans	The politically charged job of running the Smithsonian Institution, the world’s largest group of museums, has been passed to a cardiologist and university administrator who promises to help bridge the gap between arts and sciences.; David Skorton, currently president of Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, will take over from Wayne Clough as secretary of the Washington-based museum and research body next year, at a time of rising financial squeeze and political interference.; Clough, who announced his retirement in September, was heavily criticised in 2010 for bowing to pressure to remove a video from the National Portrait Gallery that Republican leaders said was anti-Christian because it contained a clip of ants crawling on a crucifix.; At a press conference, Skorton skirted the issue of how he would tackle the job’s political pressures, but stressed that a national emphasis on prioritising science and technology spending should not overshadow the role of arts and cultural institutions in US public life.; “Important as these disciplines are, I can tell you that a life in medicine has told me that we will not solve our thorniest problems through science alone,” he said.; “We need to draw in ethics and humanities and what arts can teach us … I believe the American people and people around the world mostly see the museums, the galleries and National Zoo and I believe they may not see so clearly the people standing behind these institutions and there are many who may be more visible thought leaders for the country.”; Skorton cited the Asian art in the Freer and Sackler Galleries as his favourite parts of the Smithsonian, but otherwise did not have anything specific to say about the institution’s wide-ranging exhibits or long-term goals. Until he assumes the office, in July 2015, he will visit Washington frequently in order to “come up to speed” and learn from Clough. He has said he will largely drop his medical work.; Skorton also paid tribute to his predecessor’s role in digitising much of the Smithsonian’s collections. Clough will stay on through 2014, and a temporary secretary will serve in the interim.; Founded in 1846, the Smithsonian is the world’s largest museum and research complex, consisting of 19 museums and galleries, the National Zoological Park and nine research facilities. Skorton was picked from a shortlist of 20 candidates selected by headhunters.; John Roberts the US chief justice, who also serves as Smithsonian chancellor, said: “David Skorton demonstrated keen vision and skilled leadership as the president of two great American universities.; “His character, experience and talents are an ideal match for the Smithsonian’s broad and dynamic range of interests, endeavours and aspirations.”
