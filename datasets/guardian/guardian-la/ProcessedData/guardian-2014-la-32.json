Grant plays Keith Michaels, a chauvinist misanthrope (with a broken heart, natch) who once bagged an Oscar for penning \u201cParadise Misplaced\u201d, but who is now creepily bedding students with daddy issues. Unsurprisingly, \u201chumourless Jane Austen scholar\u201d (as per the press notes \u2013 really) Professor Mary Weldon (Allison Janney, wasted) wants him run off campus. More bafflingly, Marisa Tomei\u2019s sprightly single mom/grad student sees something in him which she doesn\u2019t want to slap \u2013 a mystery, frankly. With its top-notch supporting cast (Janney, Tomei, JK Simmons) The Rewrite couldn\u2019t be entirely unlikable, and does boast several early chuckles, but it remains at best disposably flippant \u2013 Josh Radnor\u2019s Liberal Arts is Citizen Kane by comparison. Grant knows how to deliver a line and isn\u2019t afraid to play a sleazeball (albeit a redeemable one) but you keep wishing Richard Curtis was on hand to put better \u2013 and crucially funnier \u2013 words in his mouth.\n",
