Friday 18 October 2013 09.32 EDT	It's no secret: we need more women in security	The female code-breakers of Bletchley Park may have hoped others would follow in their footsteps, but the number of women in cyber security is still woefully low	If the wood-panelled walls of Bletchley Park house could talk, they would reveal much more about the secret code-breaking activities that went on in the former stately home than its previous inhabitants ever could.; "Often we get people who come back and find out more about what they were doing here than they knew before," chief executive Iain Standen explains.; "It was a very closed shop. We had a lady come back about a year ago and said she used to work on enigma. We looked up where she was working and actually she wasn't â€“ she was working on something completely different, much higher up and much more important. She didn't know."; The story of Bletchley Park still piques interest many years after the last code-breaker put down their multi-coloured pen, and not just because of the impact cryptanalysis had on World War II, shortening it by around two years. The spotlight often falls on the role women played, from recording code to calculating patterns and operating code-breaking machines.; The country park was home to the Government Code and Cypher School, which later became GCHQ. Staff were drawn from all over the country, many had no military background and were volunteered into the service from universities, where languages and mathematics were particularly sought after.; "I don't think women would have had those opportunities if we hadn't been at war at the time. That's patently clear," Standen explains. Three quarters of the staff were female and many held important roles. Despite this, most women received small sums of money for their work, vastly less than their male colleagues.; They were given the title of linguist instead of code-breaker, even though they often only spoke English, in a bid to pay them more than what they were officially entitled to.; Most staff would never have known what they were working on. In fact, Standen believes that only around 30 people out of a staff of around 10,000 at its peak would have known how significant their work was to the war effort.; "They were working six and a half days a week around the clock on shifts. They would come in for an eight-hour shift, be given some calculations to do, hand them back and that was it," he explains.; The role female staff played is particularly interesting when you consider that since Bletchley Park closed its doors, the number of women in cyber security and other related fields has remained painfully low.; "I find it hard to explain that we had women like Baroness Pauline Neville Jones at the top but it didn't somehow make a difference in the pipeline of talent coming through, and we're still in this position," says Dr Brooke Hoskins, director of strategy and government relations at Raytheon.; The defence and security experts sponsored a recent Cyber Security Challenge and Women's Security Society event at the park to celebrate women in the sector in the past, present and future.; "If you say the word cyber people think of hackers and when people think of a hacker they think of a 16-year-old boy in his bedroom with no friends and no social skills, beavering away. That's sad," she adds, explaining that it's a loss to the industry that women don't see cyber security and intelligence as a natural career choice.; A lack of role models, problematic recruitment processes (try suggesting quotas to a security service for which you're not allowed to admit you have applied) and a history of male, military dominance are all issues to contend with, to shift the gender balance.; That's something that Stephanie Daman, chief executive of Cyber Security Challenge, hopes will happen, and fast. She believes that a new school curriculum will show young women that security is about more than technical ability.; "There is a skills gap when it comes to cyber security, we have a lost generation. We took our eye off the ball a little bit in education when we stopped teaching computing and started teaching Excel and word processing instead.; "We haven't made enough noise about it to the generation coming through. There seems to be a perception that you can't wear make up and dress nicely and be in this profession and that's complete rubbish."; Promoting women into senior positions and company boards is the next step, adds Hoskins. "The whole leadership and promotion structure is written around male competencies and in a male language and so it's only by having more women that you get a different image of leadership.; "People are scared to talk about it because you suddenly start stereotyping, but we have got to take the plunge. It's unconscious sexism that's built into the system, it's changing slowly but I think it's changing faster in other industries," she adds.; Addressing the security event at Bletchley earlier this month, Lucy Robson, a university student and Cyber Security Challenge candidate explained why she decided to pursue a career in security, despite having studied humanities subjects at school.; "The industry is dynamic and multifaceted; because of the human element you can never guarantee how technologies or systems will be used. As such, it provides immensely satisfying roles," she said.; And yet there is still much to be learnt from the women of Bletchley Park. Hoskins asked women at the event to raise their hands if they had asked for a promotion at work, just a handful did so. Most notable among them were the Bletchley veterans, who couldn't hide their bewilderment at the many women whose hands remained down.; "When you look at what happened at Bletchley Park, they realised that you can't afford to have people on the sidelines, you need all the best talent in the right places," explains Natalie Black, deputy director of cyber defence and public networks in the Cabinet office.; Perhaps it's time to take back some of that wartime mentality and push recruiters and women to challenge themselves, as the Bletchley Park veterans did.; Sign up to become a member of the Women in Leadership community here for more comment, analysis and best practice direct to your inbox
