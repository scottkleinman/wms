# About the Datasets

This is just a collection of data I had on hand, which I've been using to test the WMS. If I remember correctly `test.zip` is a datapackage I exported from a project (there's also an extracted `test` folder with the contents).

I've been testing with the `guardian` folder. Some of the data may have been unchanged materials you sent me, but I can say that the `guardian/guardian-h/ProcessedData` folder at least contains manifest schema v2.0-compatible JSON files which can be imported to the database through WMS. I'm not sure about the other materials.

I don't have any data for `Sources`. I think I just made a few manifests for `new_york_times` and `guardian` using the WMS. There are also no projects other than the test one, and you have that (see paragraph 1 above). The `Scripts` module is not yet functional, so just ignore it.
