The film\u2019s fundraising page notes, \u201cStorytelling was a way of enduring the potent rawness Joan experienced through life, and through loss. Now we must be the ones to preserve this. To preserve her legacy.\u201d; But for Dunne, it\u2019s more personal. \u201cThis is a story that I\u2019m telling in order to live,\u201d he says in the trailer for the documentary. \u201cWhen she\u2019s not here, I will be.\u201d; It\u2019s quite the story, too. Didion published her first novel in 1963, at the age of 29, while she was still working her way up the masthead at Vogue. Upon moving to California with her husband John Gregory Dunne, Didion published what many consider her pre-eminent work, Slouching Towards Bethlehem, a pitch perfect and searing collection of magazine essays. Since then she has written five novels, a play, a handful of screenplays and eight books of essays, including The Year of Magical Thinking, which won the National Book Award for nonfiction and cemented her reputation as one of the most esteemed writers of our time. In 2013, President Obama awarded her the National Medals of Arts and Humanities. In the trailer for the film, Dunne calls Didion \u201cperhaps the most influential American writer alive\u201d, and it\u2019s hard to disagree.; At almost 80 years old, Didion has barely slowed down. The trailer for the film shows her diligently still writing at her desk. \u201cSome writers \u2013 and Joan is one \u2013 they need to write,\u201d explains Dunne in the trailer. \u201cJoan writes to survive.\u201d; Despite her long and storied career, no one has yet made a film about her. \u201cWe\u2019re making [this film] because \u2013 incredibly \u2013 no one else has made a documentary about Joan Didion. It\u2019s a mystery,\u201d Dunne says in the trailer. (A mystery perhaps solved by the recognition that because Didion has devoted her career to a careful introspection and self-analysis, no one but family would dare to take up the task.); Dunne started filming his aunt a few years ago, when he made a short film to accompany her latest memoir, Blue Nights, a starkly conscientious consideration of ageing and parenting. According to the documentary\u2019s Kickstarter page, \u201cAfter hours of watching her read and reflect, it became clear that we could not stop there \u2013 we had to do something much larger and deeper.\u201d; Based on the trailer for the film, which is still in production, the documentary appears to neatly weave together Didion\u2019s past and present, taking photographs from her personal life, clips of the critical news events she covered, including the Manson family, and interviews with people who have worked with her. Author and musician Patti Smith, actors Vanessa Redgrave and Allison Janney, Vanity Fair editor-in-chief Graydon Carter, and author Bret Easton Ellis are already on board for the project, which Dunne calls \u201ca collage that captures the emotions of the time\u201d.; Dunne also captured footage of Didion reading her own words and offering her own take on her legacy and influence on journalism and literature alike. \u201cThe film will be very visual by using her prose,\u201d Dunne told Vogue.com. \u201cThe narration is already written, because Joan has been writing it since she was a little girl.\u201d; The book trailer for Blue Nights gives a sense of what the full documentary might feel like, filled with close-ups of Didion\u2019s face, detailed shots of her hands writing and an overall intimate and deeply personal feel.; According to the film\u2019s Kickstarter page, the movie \u201cwill tell Joan\u2019s story through passages she has chosen (and will read aloud) from her work, as her friends, family, colleagues and critics share their accounts of her remarkable life and writing\u201d. One particularly poignant scene features Didion at her desk, reading from her computer screen: \u201cLife changes fast. Life changes in the instant.\u201d It\u2019s the opening words to Didion\u2019s autobiographical novel The Year of Magical Thinking, which chronicled the unthinkable year where she lost both her husband and daughter. It\u2019s a moving moment from the film\u2019s six-minute trailer and it bodes well for the power of a full-length documentary.; Telling his aunt\u2019s story, Dunne said, \u201cis a heady responsibility that I want to get right.\u201d; \u201cPeople don\u2019t know what Joan sounds like,\u201d says Dunne in the trailer. \u201cThey don\u2019t know that a woman so tiny in frame is a lion.\u201d; The campaign for We Tell Ourselves Stories in Order to Live is at Kickstarter",
