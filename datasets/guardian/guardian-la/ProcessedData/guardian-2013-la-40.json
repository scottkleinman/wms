Victoria\u2019s prison population has grown by nearly 50% over the past decade.; \u201cWe are reaching critical conditions in Victoria where prisoners are being kept in double bunking situations that are unsafe,\u201d Michelle McDonnell, senior policy adviser at Smart Justice, told Guardian Australia.; \u201cThe rate of increase is unsustainable and we need to look for alternatives. We need to reduce crime before it happens, to divert money towards primary prevention, not just concentrate on the consequences of crime.\u201d; McDonnell blamed the overcrowding on the government\u2019s scrapping of suspended sentences, ending of home detention and tightening up of the parole system in the wake of the Jill Meagher murder case.; \u201cPrison is a harsh and blunt instrument that doesn\u2019t necessarily rehabilitate people,\u201d she said. \u201cIt potentially sets up people for a lifetime of reoffending because once they get out, they can\u2019t get a job.\u201d; McDonnell said the situation for female prisoners was particularly concerning.; \u201cThe majority of women in prison are victims themselves of sexual abuse,\u201d she said. \u201cThey face many obstacles in prison, such as degrading strip searches, which can retraumatise them. It\u2019s a dehumanising environment.\u201d; Susan Shepherd, who was imprisoned for two years for theft and deception, told Guardian Australia prison was \u201cone big horror house\u201d for women.; Shepherd was convicted in 2007 for stealing nearly $500,000, which she fed into poker machines as part of a severe gambling addiction.; \u201cPrison was completely punitive to everyone there,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was a population of bored housewives, most of them there for white-collar crime. I\u2019d say you could release 80% of female prisoners and public safety would not change one iota.; \u201cPrison doesn\u2019t work. The parolees who commit horrendous crimes prove that because they should have been reformed by then. Their parole is revoked and it absolves prisons of any of the responsibility.; \u201cI\u2019m still recovering, four years on. It\u2019s year zero for me \u2013 I lost my career and all my possessions. I went from having a partner and children and a home to being drugged in the mental health unit of a maximum-security prison within 18 months. How on earth can that happen to someone?; \u201cIt\u2019s sort of like the Truman Show \u2013 a big sign says \u2018education\u2019 but there\u2019s nothing behind the sign. I tried for three months to do a liberal arts degree. There was nothing there, no help.\u201d; The Victorian government said it was cracking down on areas such as parole to meet public expectations about safety, blaming the previous Labor state government for the overcrowding.; \u201cIt would have been much better if Labor's soft-on-crime approach had not left Victoria with a shortage of prison beds,\u201d said the attorney general, Robert Clark.; \u201cHowever, while new beds are being built, it is far better to have dangerous offenders behind bars, even in police cells, rather than walking free on the streets.\u201d\n",
