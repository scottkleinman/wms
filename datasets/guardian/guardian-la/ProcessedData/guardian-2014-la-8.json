You just can\u2019t take away the memory of all that remains\tA few weeks ago, I visited a former professor at my liberal arts college to talk to her class about writing, and how a person might make a career of it, and if a person might make a career of it. Because, of course, that part remains highly debatable.; As I told the students about my post-graduate experience, during which I transitioned from copy editing and managing the production of print magazines to writing for online venues \u2013 to blogging, that word sure to be outdated beyond recognition soon enough \u2013 and then, for goodness sakes, to finishing an actual paper-and-ink book, I had a nostalgic thought.; \u201cDo you guys still use those little blue books, for exams?\u201d I asked. When I went to this college in the late 1990s, the squat paper notebooks were pretty much always provided for students in which to pen \u2013 or, rather, pencil \u2013 their final essays, in the allotted time, during class. By hand. From whatever was in our brains, without a book or a computer to rely on. I remember an occasional proud moment when I had so much to say that I could fill two blue books; that was a sure sign of an A. I don\u2019t remember my hand cramping the way it does today when I write a three-sentence note sans keyboard.; The students \u2013 sophomores and juniors and seniors with iPhones and laptops within an arm\u2019s reach \u2013 shook their heads, perplexed, and even my teacher couldn\u2019t remember the last time the blue books had been used. \u201cSee, I\u2019m really ancient,\u201d I said, laughing, knowing full well that nowadays, paper and pencil scribblings aren\u2019t the most useful or efficient way to showcase a student\u2019s expertise. At the same time, I couldn\u2019t help feeling just a bit misty about those old bound brochures, empty and waiting for my thoughts as they\u2019d been at the time.; This is not all that different from how I feel about Wednesday\u2019s news from the College Board that the SAT, the venerable old SAT, is changing. Of course, it had already changed from what it was when I took it by hand, a test with a total score of 1600 upon which I predictably did well at verbal and fairly poorly in math. In the time since then, it gained an essay portion, changed the total score possible, and now with the latest changes the essay is optional and the SAT is back to a ceiling of 1600 again.; What I remember most about studying for the SAT is that I just kept studying verbal when I should have been practicing math. I made flashcards of words I\u2019d read once in books or had never read at all and was discovering for the first time. I guess as a word nerd I was a little bit in love with vocabulary then, just as I am today.; Vocabulary, however, is something that will be very different in the new SAT. As Julia Ryan writes at The Atlantic, \u201cThe era of \u2018SAT words\u2019 is over.\u201d Instead of testing on \u201cinchoate\u201d, \u201cpertinacious\u201d and \u201ctoady\u201d, the exam will put forth words \u201cwidely used in college and career\u201d, like \u201csynthesis\u201d and \u201cempirical\u201d. (For what it\u2019s worth, I\u2019ve used \u201cinchoate\u201d and \u201ctoady\u201d in my career, but I just had to Google \u201cpertinacious\u201d for a refresher.) The College Board, one might say, has not been pertinacious with regard to its vision for the SAT.; The intention behind this overhaul is indisputably good, to make college more accessible for low-income students, and to more fairly assess college and career readiness across boards that are not confined to students who can afford to pay for expensive SAT tutors. But as we become more and more practical in preparing for college, careers and life, we necessarily let go of some of the deep, uncharted and individual aspects of learning. If the SAT is simply a test of what students have already learned in school, they\u2019ve lost the chance to discover new loves in studying for the SAT. Like the word contumacious! Lugubrious! Alacrity! And whether we remember or use everything we crammed into our brains for a single score, the act of studying those things has changed us and, quite possibly, led us to the careers in which we find ourselves many years later.; A college admission test is never the whole picture of a student, of course. But I can\u2019t help feeling sentimental about my time spent studying vocabulary words, and a dash lugubrious that others won\u2019t have that same experience. If I hadn\u2019t had to learn them for the SAT, I might not have discovered them in the first place. (Then again, perhaps it was only a matter of time.) As for writing essays, well, I don\u2019t much care if aspiring college students are writing them in blue books or private journals or on Tumblr or on the SAT. The important thing is that essays continue to be written, and I think they will be.; I do, however, take umbrage with one thing Dr Les Perelman, director of undergraduate writing at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, told David Coleman in 2012, before Coleman became president of the College Board. As Todd Balf writes in this weekend\u2019s New York Times Magazine, Perelman asked:; For anyone who writes, or blogs, as a career, well, that\u2019s pretty often \u2013 though of course, we\u2019re not doing it in blue books anymore.\n",
