Until he assumes the office, in July 2015, he will visit Washington frequently in order to \u201ccome up to speed\u201d and learn from Clough. He has said he will largely drop his medical work.; Skorton also paid tribute to his predecessor\u2019s role in digitising much of the Smithsonian\u2019s collections. Clough will stay on through 2014, and a temporary secretary will serve in the interim.; Founded in 1846, the Smithsonian is the world\u2019s largest museum and research complex, consisting of 19 museums and galleries, the National Zoological Park and nine research facilities. Skorton was picked from a shortlist of 20 candidates selected by headhunters.; John Roberts the US chief justice, who also serves as Smithsonian chancellor, said: \u201cDavid Skorton demonstrated keen vision and skilled leadership as the president of two great American universities.; \u201cHis character, experience and talents are an ideal match for the Smithsonian\u2019s broad and dynamic range of interests, endeavours and aspirations.\u201d",
