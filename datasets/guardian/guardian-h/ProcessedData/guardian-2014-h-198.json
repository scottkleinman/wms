These episodes have become writer Gareth Roberts\u2019 \u201cthing\u201d \u2013 he penned the James Corden specials for Matt Smith (The Lodger and Closing Time). So The Caretaker might run the risk of repeating itself, except for the fact that both of those episodes amounted to slight curios, sidesteps from the main narrative when they were giving Karen Gillan a week off. This, on the other hand, is so steeped in continuity and \u201carc-ness\u201d that it\u2019s practically a soap. In a good way.; Ofsted would be plunged into crisis if the true nature of Shoreditch\u2019s Coal Hill school ever became apparent. We\u2019ve yet to discover whether Clara\u2019s employment there is for some big plot reason, but it\u2019s no surprise that trouble has found its way there. It\u2019s also telling that the Doctor has yet to inform Clara of his own long history with the place \u2013 this was where his granddaughter Susan tried to pass herself off as a normal Earth girl and he inadvertently picked up Ian and Barbara (the last big office romance among the teaching staff) as travelling companions way back in 1963. Times have changed; the place now has a life-sized chessboard and the humanities teachers all dress like hipsters, but the artron emissions emanating from the school\u2019s troubled timeline have made it easy bait.; In truth, the alien incursion part of this story is its weakest element, but basing itself in story and character as it does, you barely notice the joins. Jenna Coleman gets her best ever comedy here, doing incredible work with a simple widening of her eyes, while Capaldi continues to imbue his supposedly \u201cDark Doctor\u201d with levity and empathy. When he mistakes Adrian for Clara\u2019s boyfriend on account of the bow tie, who wasn\u2019t cheering on the fool? And as annoying children in Doctor Who go, Ellis George\u2019s Courtney Woods is what we call \u201cone to watch\u201d.; And yet, fancy this \u2013 we\u2019re halfway through the series and there is yet to be a duff episode. And, even more remarkably, most people seem to actually agree on that. Extraordinary scenes.; As awkward moments to first use the L-word go, having just been outed to your boyfriend as a secret time-traveller is going to take some beating. But as Clara\u2019s carefully constructed house of cards collapses around her, the deftness of this series begins to play out. As crazy as I went over the timey-wimey River Song arc back in Matt\u2019s era, this more grounded, emotional story is paying off hugely. Here, nobody is completely right and everyone is a little bit wrong.; For all his bravery and humility, Danny is still showing signs of being the alpha male whose insecurity leads him to make things all about him. Clara is living in a fool\u2019s paradise, thinking she can get away with living both these lives at once. And this Doctor, once again, is proving himself to be needy and tempestuous behind the bravado. It\u2019s a brave version of Doctor Who, where everybody is written so honestly and as brutally flawed, and we\u2019re only halfway through. The Doctor and Danny\u2019s rivalry is an absolute dead heat as to who is right and who is wrong, and if either of these male egos were to make her choose (something which I doubt she would stand for anyway) I couldn\u2019t call which way she would go.; Courtney Woods might wish to check herself if she decides she really does want to follow her English teacher off out into space.; For all that the Doctor talks it up, the Skovox Blitzer isn\u2019t exactly the most menacing killing machine the universe has ever known. It made me laugh more than anything, trundling along looking like a robot Silurian on a mobility scooter \u2013 which may or may not have been the point. Did it matter that the world never felt under much of a threat? Maybe, but also maybe best to chalk this up to being another of the \u201cfunny ones\u201d. That said, the policeman\u2019s severed hand almost made me vomit a little.; As is becoming more and more obvious, the big storyline this year looks to be the complicated Doctor-Clara-Danny triangle, and it may not end particularly well. But we also got a welcome dose of the other arc, as that policeman finds himself joining Half Face Man and Gretchen in the Promised Land named for the first time as \u201cthe Nethersphere\u201d. And its pen-pusher is Chris Addison as Seb. They clearly have good people skills up in heaven, even when the management are having an off-day. Michelle Gomez\u2019s Missy does not look happy. What can have gone wrong?; \u2022 Clara\u2019s jealousy issues now extend not only to all her predecessors but to Jane Austen too. \u201cOh what, I suppose she was your bezzie mate was she, and you went on holidays together and then you got kidnapped by boggans from space and then you all formed a band and met Buddy Holly!\u201d; \u2022 Nice to see River has not been forgotten completely.; \u2022 We all know there are few things in the world more malevolent than the PE teacher. I\u2019ll share my horror stories if you\u2019ll share yours \u2026; \u2022 Danny\u2019s inability understand the \u201cdifferent\u201d way that Clara might love the Doctor has become my only real problem with him. So much that I almost get the Doctor\u2019s antipathy toward him. What sort of person really believes there\u2019s only one, sexual, kind of love?; \u2022 \u201cIt\u2019s funny, you only really know what someone thinks of you when you know what lies they\u2019ve told you.\u201d; Courtney Woods gets her big moment as the first woman on the moon. But there are bigger challenges ahead, and by the end of Kill the Moon, the Doctor and Clara\u2019s relationship might never be the same again \u2026",
