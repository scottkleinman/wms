Additional points were given to candidates facing an unexpected disadvantage, such as the bereavement of a close family member.; Penalties on staff for malpractice in exams also increased, from 62% to 97%, although in 2011 the figure was higher.; Some 2,590 penalties were given to pupils, a similar figure to last year. Using unauthorised material was the most common reason, which usually meant accessing a mobile phone.; The number of pupils caught trying to use mobiles, however, has dropped for the fourth consecutive year.; Read more on the findings from Ofqual on the BBC.; The positive effects of online forums should be more widely acknowledged, according to experts.; Oxford University researchers analysed 14 different studies on how young people use the internet.; The review found that online chatrooms could support and connect young people who were isolated in society.; A number of the studies had found a link between internet use and self-harm and suicide, but there were also examples of forums encouraging positive behaviour. For example, by helping people seek support and offering congratulations for not harming themselves.; A strong link between internet forums and an increased risk of suicide was highlighted by the review.; Read more on the review's findings in the Plos One journal.; Social science graduates have a better chance of securing paid employment than arts and science graduates, data shows.; People with degrees in subjects like economics and sociology are also more likely to be in managerial or senior roles.; The Campaign for Social Science analysed data on graduate destinations from the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA).; After three years of finishing their degree, 84.2% of social science students were employed, compared to 79% of arts and humanities graduates and 78% of graduates with science degrees.; Some 7.6% of employed social science graduates were in manager or senior positions, compared to 3.6% of those with science degrees and 6.2% of those who studied arts and humanities subjects.; The figures concerned more than 62,000 students who finished university in 2009.; Read the full report from the Campaign for Social Science.\n",
