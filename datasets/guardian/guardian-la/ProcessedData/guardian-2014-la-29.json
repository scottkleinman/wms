But her films are nudging their way towards the mainstream\tKelly Reichardt makes small, hushed films about the invisible flotsam of the American west. Her natural subjects are the drifters and the outcasts, the barely getting by. Her natural habitat is the lonesome campfire and the railroad track. She says she lives like a bum, she makes hardly any money. Her very presence at the Venice film festival, I\u2019m guessing, is the result of some ghastly administrative error.; But here is the paradox. With each passing film, Reichardt finds herself hauled out of the shadows and nudged towards the mainstream. The murmurous, mesmerising Old Joy made way for the wrenching Wendy and Lucy, which stranded pensive Michelle Williams on the fringes of town. This in turn was overtaken by the acclaimed Meek\u2019s Cutoff, a western with a difference, marooned in the desert. Reichardt\u2019s pictures creep up on audiences, but they are so potent and so haunting that they prove hard to ignore. They call out to the world, perhaps louder than she\u2019d like.; The latest, Night Moves, is the most clamorous of all, in that it boasts a pair of rising young stars and a plot that might briefly be confused for that of a high-concept thriller. Jesse Eisenberg and Dakota Fanning are a pair of corn-fed eco-activists who hatch a plot to blow up a hydroelectric dam in the forest. Meanwhile the film darts, head down, from the organic farm to the feed store to the woodland lake where the time-bomb is ticking, across an Oregon interior the director has been mapping for years. We are never quite sure whether the plan will come off. We are never even certain whether these crusaders are intended to be read as heroes or villains. Night Moves plays its cards close to its chest and implicitly asks the audience to deliver a verdict.; It is the last interview of the day, although Reichardt has yet to settle. She curls her slender frame into a corner of the couch and tugs her knees to her chin, apparently determined to take up as little space as possible. Night Moves, she explains, is the perfect Oregon story because the Pacific Northwest feels like the environmental frontline. It\u2019s last gasp of the old frontier, a clashing contrast of civilisation and nature, industry and activism. \u201cIt\u2019s all right in your face,\u201d she says.\u201dThere\u2019s always a train going by with a forest of redwoods on the back of it. Or you go into the cities and you can smell the lumber plants everywhere.\u201d I suspect she would quite like to be there, hanging out in the hippy farm or the lumber yard. Anywhere other than this Venice hotel with its polished fittings and the gondolas gliding by on the canal at our backs.; She was raised on the east coast, in Dade County, Florida. Her parents were cops (Dad a crime-scene investigator, Mum a narcotics agent) but they broke up when she was young; both started new families, and she basically feels she has been rattling loose ever since. She\u2019s based in New York, but she shoots out west. When she\u2019s not leading a film crew across the desert, or through the woods, she supplements her income by teaching at a number of liberal arts colleges.; The students, she suggests, regard her as a bit of a crackpot. They are so grounded, so groomed, so perfectly content. They would never dream of riding the box-cars to Alaska, let alone attempt to bomb a dam to make a political point like the activists in Night Moves. \u201cI don\u2019t see much concern or interest,\u201d she says. \u201cI mean, granted, I\u2019m around kids who can afford to go to these fancy colleges. But the kids I know, I love them, but they\u2019re not mad the way we used to be. They like their parents. They have plenty of money. They seem so unafraid and so un-angry. It makes them very nice people. It doesn\u2019t make for great art. I ask them all the time: \u2018Aren\u2019t you mad at anything?\u2019 They look at me like I\u2019m off my rocker.\u201d; My sense is that she rather relishes the role of outsider. The very notion of success appears to cause her discomfort. \u201cWell, that depends what we think of as success,\u201d she counters. \u201cI mean, I think the films are both imperfect and successful in showing the parts of life that we don\u2019t often see on screen. To me, it\u2019s a case of: is the scene successful? Is the shot successful?\u201d; OK, but that\u2019s not what I meant. The very fact that Reichardt gets these movies made \u2013 the simple fact that she is here in competition at the Venice film festival \u2013 makes her a highly successful director, whether she likes it or not.; \u201cAll right, good,\u201d she shrugs. \u201cI\u2019ll take it. But what\u2019s success? Every time I make one of these films I assume it\u2019s the last. Especially after Meek\u2019s Cutoff, I thought I\u2019ll never make another one. Here I am dragging these actors through the desert and we can\u2019t even see their faces; clearly this isn\u2019t working. But yes, it has allowed me a nice teaching job. I don\u2019t own anything, if that\u2019s your measure of success. But I have a good life. I have an interesting job. I get to make these films with people I love.\u201d She thinks it over. \u201cLook, if you\u2019re from Florida and you get out of Florida and build a life full of interesting people, then you\u2019re successful already. The rest is just a bonus.\u201d; Is Florida that bad? \u201cOh yeah,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty bad.\u201d; I\u2019m betting Night Moves will not be the last film she makes. But who can say? The future is uncertain and the way ahead is dark. And one of the things I love about Reichardt\u2019s pictures is their devastating deployment of the hanging ending. I\u2019m thinking of wonky Kurt (beautifully played by the singer Will Oldham), left wandering city streets at the end of Old Joy, hapless Wendy, still looking for Alaska, or Meek\u2019s Cutoff\u2019s lost pioneers, forever strung between triumph and disaster. These films do not so much resolve as dissolve. They leave us dangling, forced to write their third acts in our heads.; Reichardt does not know why her movies have a tendency to turn full circle. She blames her regular collaborator, the writer Jon Raymond, but she\u2019s only joking; it is her own fault as well. \u201cMaybe I\u2019m suspicious of absolutes,\u201d she concedes. \u201cI mean, yes, there is something satisfying about watching an old film when the music rises up and the words come at you \u2013 The End. But it would seem absurd to do that at the end of one of my films. It would just make them feel lopsided, because they\u2019re all so short, they cover so little time. We don\u2019t know where these people were before. We spent a week with them and then on they went. My films are just glimpses of people passing through.\u201d; She admits that she sometimes finds herself thinking of these characters and wondering what on earth they\u2019re up to now. Some of them, she suspects, reflect her own personality. \u201cI remember when I was first trying to make Night Moves, I was working at it for a year and it just wasn\u2019t happening,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI\u2019m 49 years old and I\u2019ve gone out to Oregon and in the course of eight months I stayed in 21 different places. And I thought: Jesus, I\u2019m nearly 50 and here I am still couch-hopping. I\u2019m so pathetic; this is such a pitiful existence. I\u2019ve finally outdone the Kurt character in Old Joy.\u201d; She doesn\u2019t know what she is going to do. The meter is running; she can\u2019t couch-hop all her life. She ought to knuckle down and make some proper money. At least Night Moves, I suggest, might provide her ticket to the big time. It\u2019s got Jesse Eisenberg, Dakota Fanning and a ticking time-bomb at its centre. If Night Moves can\u2019t secure her a directing gig on the next Spider-Man picture, then I don\u2019t know what will.; Reichardt looks aghast. She wonders whether I\u2019m serious. A director-for-hire on a studio blockbuster? As if that would be the best possible solution for her so-called career. As if it would even happen anyway; the very prospect makes her snort. \u201cPut it this way,\u201d she says. \u201cThere is as much chance of them calling you up to ask you to direct Spider-Man as there is to call me. I\u2019m not even kidding, they\u2019d call your number first.\u201d; I don\u2019t believe this for an instant, and yet Reichardt just might, or at least she might need to. She has to feel that she is still out on the margins, at one with the misfits, couch-hopping her way from one crisis to the next. It is the fiction she spins in order to keep her films honest.; Night Moves is out in the UK on 29 Aug\n",
