Saturday 17 August 2013 14.18 EDT	Language teaching crisis as 40% of university departments face closure	Number of universities offering modern languages degrees plunges from 105 in 2000 to 62 at start of this academic year	As many as 40% of university language departments are likely to close within a decade, the former government adviser charged with bolstering foreign language uptake in higher education has warned, delivering a huge blow to the UK's diplomatic and economic hopes.; Amid a deepening crisis in language learning – which is causing alarm at the highest levels of government – the number of universities offering degrees in modern languages has already plunged from 105 in 2000 to 62 at the start of this academic year.; The rate of attrition is expected to continue into the next decade. A further 20 departments will be vulnerable to closure in the next 10 years, but there is growing concern that the pace of decline is set to quicken, according to Professor Mike Kelly, a former adviser on the Department for Education's steering group on languages and now head of the government-funded Routes into Languages programme co-ordinating attempts to increase the uptake of language degrees in England.; Huge areas of the country are being left without any degree-level language courses, which in turn is reducing the number of language teachers in schools, compounding the crisis. Last week it emerged that A-level candidates for French and German fell by 50% between 1996 and 2012.; The Foreign Office has become increasingly concerned about the future of its diplomatic corps, with senior figures privately voicing urgent concerns about the standard of its graduate recruits. It has built its own languages school and is spending £1m a year to bring the civil service up to scratch.; The British Chamber of Commerce said it feared a "potentially disastrous" impact on the UK's export potential when David Cameron has ordered a doubling of trade with the wider world. Even the government's ability to reform the EU over the long term is being set back, with just 3% of European bureaucrats being British despite the UK contributing 11% of Europe's population.; Kelly, a professor of French at Southampton University, said: "British graduates are not being employed in the key European institutions and one of the reasons is you need two foreign languages. There is a lot of concern.; "The danger is that the pace of reduction of university language departments will increase for two reasons: the number taking A-level [languages] has dipped quite sharply and those recruiting successfully are being encouraged to take on more students, so fewer students are available for struggling departments."; The latest official figures show a 13% year-on-year fall in the number of students accepted to read for a language degree in 2013 as part of a plummeting of the popularity of the subject and humanities courses in general. The figure of 4,800 language students accepted on courses for 2013 is dwarfed by the 45,560 who will read for a degree in business studies.; The universities of West of England, Staffordshire and Bolton have closed their departments in the last 12 months and Salford has indicated it will do the same.; Kelly said a range of factors caused the collapse in the popularity of languages, among them the decision in 2002 to make the subject optional at GCSE. However, he also cited the rise of Ukip, which he said was both a cause and a symptom of a growing contempt for foreign cultures: "There is an increased parochialism. General xenophobia doesn't help."; Writing in the Observer, universities minister David Willetts stresses the importance of teaching humanities in the UK's 133 universities and higher education colleges as students choose courses they see as more job-focused.; "As we try to reach out to the rest of the world, of course the humanities have a great role to play," he writes. "Without experts in anthropology, language, politics, philosophy or history would we truly understand other cultures? It is no coincidence that an English philosopher, economist and jurist, Jeremy Bentham, coined the word 'international'.; "This means that we certainly do need to keep a close eye on numbers studying modern languages in particular – one area in which Ucas applications were down."; The government has included the learning of a language among the core EBacc subjects on which schools will be judged in future. Willetts writes: "We must now wait for this to filter through to universities. And that is why the Higher Education Funding Council for England is working with institutions on safeguarding modern language provision across the country."; Nicola Dandridge, chief executive of Universities UK, which represents Britain's higher education sector, said the laws of demand and supply were inevitably forcing universities to examine their resources: "Some universities may face difficult decisions in relation to maintaining course provision in certain subject areas."
