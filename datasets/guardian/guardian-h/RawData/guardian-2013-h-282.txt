In comparison, China, Japan and Russia have focused more on publishing scientific research.; Dr Andrew Plume, associate director in scientometrics and market analysis at Elsevier, who worked on the report, believes this shift in the focus of UK research could be tied to the UK research excellence framework (REF) or former research assessment exercise (RAE) – the process of ranking research in UK universities.; He said: "In social science and humanities there is a culture of research outputs going into monographs and other forms of scholarly output that are not journal articles – and in this report we are looking at journal articles. With the drive of REF and RAE towards published outputs for a researcher, social sciences and humanities article publishing may be growing in the UK."; Despite this relative fall in the number of UK scientific papers published, universities and science minister David Willetts said: "This report clearly demonstrates the continued strength of our science research base and that the UK continues to punch above its weight."; He added: "I've often said that I want the UK to be the best place in the world to do science and this research shows that we are well on our way to achieving this goal. An excellent research base contributes directly to economic growth and is keeping us at the forefront of the global science race."; The report raises concerns that the UK may not be able to sustain its position as a world-leading research nation and that "traditional research powerhouses" such as the UK and US may be eroded by the sheer volume of research produced by emerging nations in the East, most notably China.; Other findings show that international collaboration and research mobility are key to the UK retaining its position as a world-leading research nation. The UK has the second-highest rate of international co-authorship, after France, and this rate continues to rise. The UK also had the fourth highest number of PhD graduates among the surveyed countries in 2011.; The report acknowledges that the global research ecosystem has become increasingly complex in recent years due to increased collaboration and competition in the higher education sector. It states that while the UK is well positioned to remain a research leader in the future, continued investment in the research base is essential to meeting this.; This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.
