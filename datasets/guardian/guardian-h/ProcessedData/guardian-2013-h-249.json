In August, the NSPCC reported that one in five children had been victims of cyberbullying during the last year and that a \"large number\" of users of Facebook, Twitter and YouTube were under the minimum age of 13.; Not long after, the Diana Award Anti-Bullying Ambassador Programme found that 81% of children believed cyberbullying was getting worse. One in four of the young people surveyed by the charity said one of their friends has been bullied online or via a mobile phone during the summer holidays.; More recently, research has been published on the role schools can play in confronting online abuse. Nearly 7 in 10 teachers would like schools to teach more about online safety, according to a survey by OnePoll this month.; Young people supported teacher views, with 40% saying they'd like to learn more about how to stay safe online in school. Educating people about the dangers online was seen as the best way to combat cyberbullying by 32% of the children spoken to.; But tackling online safety in the classroom can be tricky. By its very nature, what children do on the internet is secretive. It's a means of communicating away from prying adult eyes and it can be difficult to know what sites kids are using and how.; Of the 200 teachers surveyed by OnePoll, 31% thought they had inadequate knowledge of how pupils behaved online and 44% were unsure how to respond to cyberbullying.; Our panel of e-safety experts will be shining a light on what's happening in cyberspace, as well as offering advice on how to keep pupils secure online and what to do if they're a victim of abuse.; We'll also be discussing ideas to encourage pupils to think carefully about how they conduct themselves on the internet and the future of digital citizenship in the classroom. Whether you're looking for some inspiration on tackling the topic with your students, need some help with developing your school's online policy or have some tips to share, join us, Wednesday 6th November, 6pm to 8pm.; Simon Finch: @simfin Simon has 20 years experience leading workshops and training sessions in schools on e-safety, e-learning and safeguarding.
