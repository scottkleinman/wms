Tuesday 7 January 2014 16.00 EST	Written off		The "clever illusion" of memory offered by the camera is a point well made by David Shariatmadari (Comment, 2 January). It brings to mind the cautionary parable of Socrates in the Phaedrus (274), where he makes the same point about the invention of writing. The Egyptian god of the liberal arts, Theuth, presents his new technique to the king/god, Thamus, with the words: "This invention … will make the Egyptians wiser and will improve their memories; for it is an elixir of memory and wisdom I have discovered." The king berates him for his misplaced enthusiasm, and replies that, on the contrary, "this invention will produce forgetfulness in the minds of those who learn to use it, for they will not practise their memory … You have invented an elixir not of memory, but of reminding; and you offer your pupils the appearance of wisdom, not true wisdom, for they read many things without instruction and will therefore seem to know many things, when they are for the most part ignorant and hard to get along with, since they are not wise, but only appear wise."; Like snapshots of times past, I wonder how many written words, cut as aides-memoire from newspapers such as your own, lie, lost and irretrievable, in fathomless desk drawers, their relevance and wisdom long since unremembered and forgotten.
