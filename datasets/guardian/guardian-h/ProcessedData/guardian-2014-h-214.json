At 47, he was an accomplished scholar, but in two almost comically obscure niches: the movement of sodium in the gallbladder and the birdlife of New Guinea. \u201cWhat the MacArthur call said to me was, \u2018Jared, people think highly of you, and they expect important things of you, and look what you\u2019ve actually done with your career\u2019,\u201d Diamond says today. It was a painful thought for someone who recalled being told, by an admiring teacher at his Massachusetts school, that one day he would \u201cunify the sciences and humanities\u201d. Clearly, he needed a larger canvas. Even so, few could have predicted how large a canvas he would choose.; In the decades since, Diamond has enjoyed huge success with several \u201cbig books\u201d \u2013 most famously, 1997\u2019s Guns, Germs and Steel \u2013 which ask the most sweeping questions it is possible to ask about human history. For instance: why did one species of primate, unremarkable until 70,000 years ago, come to develop language, art, music, nation states and space travel? Why do some civilisations prosper, while others collapse? Why did westerners conquer the Americas, Africa and Australia, instead of the other way round? Diamond, who describes himself as a biogeographer, answers them in translucent prose that has the effect of making the world seem to click into place, each fact assuming its place in an elegant arc of pan-historical reasoning. Our interview itself provides an example: one white man arriving to interview another, in English, on the imposing main campus of the University of California, Los Angeles, in a landscape bearing little trace of the Native Americans who once thrived here. Why? Because 8,000 years ago \u2013 to borrow from Guns, Germs and Steel \u2013 the geography of Europe and the Middle East made it easier to farm crops and animals there than elsewhere.; Whether such satisfying explanations are in fact true is the subject of vicious jousting between Diamond and many anthropologists. They condemn him as a cultural imperialist, intent on excusing the horrors of colonialism while asserting the moral superiority of the west. (One 2013 article, in an ecology journal, was entitled \u201cF**k Jared Diamond\u201d, the asterisks failing to conceal the general tone of the debate.) Diamond strikes back with equal force, calling his critics \u201cidiots\u201d, unscientific timewasters and purveyors of \u201cpolitically correct blabber\u201d. So it is slightly disconcerting to meet this strident propagandist for capitalism in his faculty office. In person, Diamond is a fastidiously courteous 77-year-old with a Quaker-style beard sans moustache, and archaic New England vowels: \u201coften\u201d becomes \u201corphan\u201d, \u201carea\u201d becomes \u201ceerier\u201d. There\u2019s no computer: despite his children\u2019s best efforts, he admits he\u2019s never learned to use one.; Diamond\u2019s first big hit, The Third Chimpanzee (1992), which won a Royal Society prize, has just been reissued in an adaptation for younger readers. Like the others, it starts with a mystery. By some measures, humans share more than 97% of our DNA with chimpanzees \u2013 by any commonsense classification, we are another kind of chimpanzee \u2013 and for millions of years our achievements hardly distinguished us from chimps, either. \u201cIf some creature had come from outer space 150,000 years ago, humans probably wouldn\u2019t figure on their list of the five most interesting species on Earth,\u201d he says. Then, within the last 1% of our evolutionary history, we became exceptional, developing tools and artwork and literature, dominating the planet, and now perhaps on course to destroy it. What changed, Diamond argues, was a seemingly minor set of mutations in our larynxes, permitting control over spoken sounds, and thus spoken language; spoken language permitted much of the rest.; There are corners of Christian America where Diamond\u2019s emphasis on humans as animals \u2013 chimps in all but a few crucial respects \u2013 might be controversial in itself. Unlike Richard Dawkins and others, though, he has opted not to wade into debate with fundamentalists. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t appeal to me to argue with people I don\u2019t respect,\u201d he says. \u201cI learn from arguing with decent people whose views aren\u2019t my own \u2026 but I don\u2019t have that respect for people who insist that science is not a way of learning about the world, and who refuse to accept that humans are derived from other animals.\u201d Besides, he was about to step \u2013 unwittingly, he insists \u2013 into another minefield. Towards the end of The Third Chimpanzee, he broaches the question that would define his career: not why humans came to dominate other animals, but why some humans came to dominate others.; The question had nagged at Diamond since his early visits to New Guinea, the island that would become virtually a second home. Born in 1937 in Boston to Eastern European Jewish immigrants \u2013 his father a paediatrician, his mother a linguist and concert pianist \u2013 Diamond graduated from Harvard, then completed a PhD in physiology at Trinity College, Cambridge. By the 1970s he was teaching physiology at UCLA, but travelling to the southwest Pacific to study birds, a passion that was becoming another expertise. One day, during a long walk, he fell into step with a local politician, Yali, who posed the visiting academic a question. \u201cWhy is it that you white people developed so much cargo\u201d \u2013 meaning manufactured goods, medicines, clothing \u2013 \u201cbut we black people had little cargo of our own?\u201d Diamond elaborates: \u201cPeoples of Eurasian origin \u2026 dominate the modern world in wealth and power \u2026 why did wealth and power become distributed as they now are, rather than in some other way? For instance, why weren\u2019t Native Americans, Africans and Aboriginal Australians the ones who decimated, subjugated or exterminated Europeans and Asians?\u201d; Guns, Germs and Steel began by repudiating the obvious, racist answer: that Eurasian peoples won out because they were smarter and more vigorous, down to their genes. Instead, it was a matter of geography. Europe and the Middle East had good soil, plenty of easily domesticable animals and plants, and a main axis running east-west, instead of north-south \u2013 meaning that crops, livestock and tools could spread easily, without confronting big changes in climate or day length. The world\u2019s first farming societies emerged, leading to bigger settlements and concentrations of political power. Meanwhile, humans living among farm animals developed immunity to the diseases they carried. By the time they encountered other societies, their military power, metal tools and, above all, their deadly germs gave them the decisive advantage. Diamond\u2019s books feature few intrepid explorers or brutal colonisers; rather, there are just accidents of geography, and their after-effects. The lack of compelling personalities didn\u2019t dent the book\u2019s success. It won a Pulitzer prize and has sold more than 1.5m copies in 36 languages. Mitt Romney quoted it admiringly in his 2012 presidential campaign, garbling its message entirely.; A naive outsider might imagine that Diamond\u2019s ideas would go down equally well with the left-leaning anthropology establishment. After all, they are explicitly a retort to racism; he denies Eurasian societies any grounds for pride at ending up on top, exposing the geographic privilege on which their success relied. But he found himself accused of \u201cgeographic determinism\u201d: in his critics\u2019 opinion, his arguments squeeze out any role for human agency and decision-making, thereby sparing history\u2019s colonisers \u2013 and today\u2019s elites \u2013 any responsibility for having created our grotesquely unjust world. As one writer put it, after the book was adapted for the US TV network PBS, his stance means that \u201ca PBS donor can sit in his Connecticut estate feeling no guilt since it was, after all, only an accident of geography that made him rich and the Bolivians poor.\u201d Jason Antrosio, an anthropologist, wrote: \u201cJared Diamond has done a huge disservice to the telling of human history.\u201d; Diamond\u2019s 2005 followup, Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Survive, redoubled his offence in his opponents\u2019 eyes. He examines how some cultures destroyed themselves by ignoring geography \u2013 the saddest example being Easter Island, whose occupants deforested their home, launching themselves on a downward spiral of war, cannibalism and eventual eradication. (The bigger message, clearly, is that we are all acting like Easter Islanders today, sabotaging ourselves by ruining the climate.) That certainly acknowledged human agency \u2013 but after allegedly excusing the oppressors, Diamond now seemed to be blaming the oppressed for their fate. The New York Times summarised his critics\u2019 take: \u201cThe haves prosper because of happenstance beyond their control, while the have-nots are responsible for their own demise.\u201d Each of the two books has the unusual distinction of having another book dedicated largely to demolishing it: Yali\u2019s Question, which offers a different answer from Diamond\u2019s New Guinean acquaintance, and Questioning Collapse, which calls the Easter Island \u201cecocide\u201d a myth.; This general charge \u2013 that Diamond offers a hugely oversimplified, morally exculpatory account of history \u2013 is the only thing that punctures his politesse. \u201cWhenever I hear the phrase \u2018geographic determinism\u2019,\u201d he says, \u201cI know I\u2019m about to waste time discussing with someone who has no right to be discussing [how human societies developed]. Because the fact is that geography has a strong influence on humans. It doesn\u2019t determine everything, but it has a strong influence.\u201d Certain anthropologists \u2013 the kind he calls \u201cnot scientists\u201d \u2013 may insist that, say, Aboriginal Australians made a cultural choice not to develop agriculture, but the fact is they simply lacked the domesticable crops or animals to do so.; Geography sometimes plays a huge role; sometimes none at all. Diamond\u2019s most vivid illustration of the latter is the former practice, in two New Guinean tribes, of strangling the widows of deceased men, usually with the widows\u2019 consent. Other nearby tribes that have developed in the same landscape don\u2019t do it, so a geographical argument can\u2019t work. On the other hand: \u201cIf you ask why the Inuit, living above the Arctic Circle, wear clothes, while New Guineans often don\u2019t, I would say culture makes a negligible contribution. I would encourage anyone who disagrees to try standing around in Greenland in January without clothes.\u201d And human choices really matter: once the Spanish encountered the Incas, Diamond argues, the Spanish were always going to win the fight, but that doesn\u2019t mean brutal genocide was inevitable. \u201cColonising peoples had massive superiority, but they had choices in how they were going to treat the people over whom they had massive superiority.\u201d; It is clear that behind these disputes, is a more general distrust among academics of the \u201cbig-picture\u201d approach Diamond has made his own. They are correct that he leans heavily on anecdote to make his case \u2013 but then it is hard to see how such an all-encompassing account could do otherwise. He attributes his taste for discipline-hopping to his childhood, especially his years at Roxbury Latin school, a private academy dating back to the 17th century, where he was encouraged to study Latin and Greek. Expectations at home were exacting, too, his sister Susan once told the LA Times that in one important school debate, the young Jared \u201csplit an infinitive and stopped dead. He looked out in the audience towards my mother, and my mother and I looked down at our laps \u2026 I\u2019m not saying we had a mother who slapped us around when we split an infinitive, but we knew you don\u2019t split infinitives.\u201d; In 1987, when Diamond was 50, his wife Marie Cohen, a UCLA psychologist, gave birth to their twin sons, Max and Joshua \u2013 and long-range theories about the history and future of the planet began to hold even more appeal for him: \u201cBefore my kids were born, I could write about how much tropical rainforest was going to be left by 2040, but 2040 might as well have been 2357: it was unreal to me. My kids won\u2019t even be at the peak of their lives by 2040. The future of the world became more real and more important.\u201d; The couple raised their boys \u201clike pygmies\u201d, he says, meaning they strove consciously to employ parenting techniques Jared had witnessed in New Guinea, allowing the children maximum freedom, letting them risk minor injury through risk-taking, and never spanking them. The notion that traditional societies might have much to teach the rest of us is the premise of Diamond\u2019s most recent book, The World Until Yesterday, published in 2012. The way that hunter-gatherer societies live today, he writes, is how all of us lived for 6m years; in all that time, mightn\u2019t they have discovered some worthwhile solutions to life\u2019s challenges?; At first glance, this argument treats indigenous cultures with respect: Diamond argues that we should let them teach us how to raise children collectively, eat more healthily and value older members of society. But the book triggered the harshest criticisms yet. In painting traditional tribes as throwbacks to another age \u2013 perhaps even in his very use of the word \u201ctraditional\u201d \u2013 Diamond was demoting them to primitive, pre-modern, \u201cfailed attempts at being us\u201d, anthropologists argued. In fact, with few exceptions, such groups aren\u2019t untouched by global trade or war; their cultures are successful attempts to thrive in such conditions. Simultaneously, the tribal rights group Survival International accused Diamond of aiding the elimination of these cultures by portraying them as incorrigibly violent and, implicitly, in need of state subjugation. (This echoed one of the more surprising episodes in the controversies over Diamond\u2019s work: a $10m lawsuit, since withdrawn, by two New Guinea tribesmen who claimed that a 2008 New Yorker article by Diamond portrayed their clan war as far more murderous than it was.); But he insists that it is Survival\u2019s stance that is dangerous. Refuse to acknowledge the downsides of tribal life, and your romantic fantasy will end up harming those you aim to protect: \u201cMistreatment of tribal peoples should be condemned not because you claim that they are peaceful when they are really not. It should instead be condemned [because it] is wrong.\u201d; One lesson of New Guinea life Diamond takes personally concerns small, recurring dangers \u2013 \u201chazards that carry a low risk each time but are encountered frequently\u201d. Once, on a field trip, he proposed setting up camp under a beautiful old tree, but his New Guinean colleagues refused. It was dead, they explained, and might kill them in the night. The chances were tiny \u2013 but if you sleep under trees many nights a year, they add up. The biggest dangers in his LA life today, Diamond believes, are slipping in the shower, tripping on uneven paving stones and car accidents. Even if the chance of serious injury or death in the bathroom is one in 1,000, that is far too big for something you do every day. He calls this attitude \u201cconstructive paranoia\u201d, and argues that it keeps tribal peoples alive: they are not lulled into assuming that everything can be fixed with a trip to the doctor. At 77, Diamond is due back in New Guinea imminently on fieldwork; he has no plans to retire from teaching, and is at work on a new book, about how societies respond to national crises. It is due to be published when he is 81 or 82. He appears to have no intention of letting falling trees or slippery showers \u2013 or, for that matter, angry anthropologists \u2013 stand in the way.; \u2022 The Third Chimpanzee: For Young People is published by Oneworld priced \u00a312.99.",
