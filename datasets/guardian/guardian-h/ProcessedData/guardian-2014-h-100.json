But ask any serious hip-hop head and they will attest to the fact that dissecting the culture \u2013 understanding something that bloomed from concrete and found its way into pop culture and beyond \u2013 is a science. The mainstream may not regard rap as particularly scholarly, but that could set to change with the advent of 9th Wonder's Hip-Hop Institute, a new interdisciplinary program based in the history department of North Carolina Central University, which he will launch this fall.; 9th Wonder, born Patrick Douthit, became a \u201cprofessor\u201d at the college when he was named Artist in Residence in 2006. Prior to that, Douthit was an assistant professor at NCCU for a Hip-Hop 101 course taught by Play of the legendary rap duo Kid-N-Play. But the idea of teaching was not new to him.; \u201cI went to school any way to become a history teacher,\u201d Douthit explains, though he did not complete his studies, instead going on to produce for artists like Jay Z, Chris Brown and Erykah Badu. \u201cIn the area where I live [Raleigh, North Carolina] there are a lot of people I went to school with who ended up being teachers,\u201d he says. \u201cThey would ask their friend who had just worked with Jay Z to come by to talk to their students. Once I got back into the classroom and talked to these kids, I realized this was why I wanted to teach in the first place. But I wasn\u2019t teaching something they were learning in school; I was teaching hip-hop.\u201d; Douthit is a trailblazer, but he is not alone in mixing hip-hop and academia. In 2010, rapper-producer and Ruff Ryders figurehead Swizz Beatz became the first Producer in Residence at New York University\u2019s Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music. That same year, UGK veteran Bun B became a professor at Rice University for hip-hop and religion/humanities. In 2013, the de facto leader of the Roots, Ahmir 'Questlove' Thompson, became a professor at NYU for a course called Topics in Recorded Music: Classic Albums and currently teaches a course there on Prince.; \u201cI started to see the deeper connection between hip-hop and the youth,\u201d says Douthit, of his own research. \u201cI started to look at the connection between the older generation and the younger generation and how I was the bridge for that. Then I started to look at vinyl sampling compared to literary licenses and I got deeper and deeper and deeper. While I was still making beats, I was still very much into the academic discourse of what hip-hop used to be and what it still is.\u201d In 2010, he taught a course at Duke called Sampling Soul, flanked by Duke's African American studies professor, Dr Mark Anthony Neal.; In addition to setting up the Hip-Hop Institute, Douthit is currently a professor at Harvard University, a three-year fellowship where he is conducting his thesis on the samples that encompass his Top 10 albums and teaching a Standards of Hip-Hop course. It\u2019s documented in his film The Hip-Hop Fellow.; \u201cI look at hip-hop like I look at a foreign language,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can\u2019t really learn how to DJ and make beats and all that unless you get a crash course on hip-hop music. So the Hip-Hop Institute will start with a hip-hop history course.\u201d; After that, the Institute will be broken into four schools, including Mass Communications, Law, History, and Music. Later, Science and Technology will be added to the roster. Along with the music and the business behind it, the writings of noted hip-hop journalists like Nelson George and Kevin Powell will be studied.; \u201cHip-hop journalism is an entirely different type of writing,\u201d Douthit reasons. There will also be masterclasses given by artists and other hip-hop associates. \u201cIt\u2019ll be a working center of hip-hop,\u201d he adds.; The Hip-Hop Institute is a testament to the success of the genre, but it also provides a destination for artists and other hip-hop authoritarians who have questioned their own next steps in what has always been regarded as 'a young man\u2019s game'. \u201cI can honestly say it\u2019s given my career a new life and a new sense of purpose,\u201d says Douthit. \u201cThere are not too many cats doing what I\u2019m doing. I\u2019m hip-hop trained, but also academically trained.\u201d; Douthit insists that he is confident in the Hip-Hop Institute's ability to prove that hip-hop has now entered a new school of thought. \u201cEverything that people think hip-hop is not, it\u2019s gonna be.\u201d",
