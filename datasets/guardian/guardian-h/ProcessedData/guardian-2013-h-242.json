Researchers have devised the method which is the first to use cloned human cells to induce hair growth, rather than redistributing hair from one part of the scalp to another. The researchers said their findings could significantly expand the use of hair transplantation to women who tend to have insufficient donor hair, as well as to men in early stages of baldness. Scientists say the research could also be an important step in creating replacement skin with hair follicles to aid the recovery of burn patients. Colin Jahoda, a professor at Durham University, says: \"Current hair-loss medications tend to slow the loss of hair follicles or potentially stimulate the growth of existing hairs, but they do not create new hair follicles. Neither do conventional hair transplants, which relocate a set number of hairs from the back of the scalp to the front. Our method, in contrast, has the potential to actually grow new follicles using a patient's own cells. This could greatly expand the utility of hair restoration surgery to women and to younger patients \u2014 now it is largely restricted to the treatment of male-pattern baldness in patients with stable disease.\"; \u2022 University of Southampton Young black women have a higher risk of breast cancer coming back than white women in the same age group, a study reveals. Findings also show that this group is more likely to have larger and more aggressive tumours and higher rates of triple negative breast cancer \u2013 a type of breast cancer that does not respond to hormone therapies. Yet even when these factors are taken into account, they do not completely explain why black women have poorer outcomes, particularly those with the type of breast cancer that is expected to be sensitive to hormones. The authors of the study say it could be explained by an as-yet unidentified biological factor such as cancers in women of African-Caribbean descent responding less well to treatments, including hormone therapy or differences in the genetics of their tumours. Ellen Copson, a senior lecturer at the University of Southampton and one of the authors, says: \"Our study confirms for the first time that black women under 41 in the UK are more likely to have breast cancer recurrence than their white counterparts, despite equal access to healthcare. The finding also backs up similar findings in the USA, suggesting that this could be an international trend, but further research is needed to try and pin down the exact cause or causes, so we can tackle this issue.\"; \u2022 Royal Holloway University The international research team at Royal Holloway is hosting an exhibition to reveal the importance of the spirit world for different cultures. The event will showcase how native communities honour the dead and connect with the spirit world. Helen Gilbert, a professor from Royal Holloway, says: \"We think about traditions such as trick-or-treating, lighting bonfires and telling ghost stories as quintessential to Halloween in the UK and Ireland, but in other parts of the world, many different cultures have their own unique and fascinating ways of connecting with the spirit world around the same time of year.\" A number of artists at the exhibition will also demonstrate the cultural philosophies and spiritual customs of Latin America.; \u2022 University of Manchester / Ghana Sixty clay figurines up to 1,400-years-old excavated by archaeologists are to be revealed for the first time outside of Ghana at the Manchester Museum. The figurines, including two-headed humans, a chameleon, a crocodile and a man on horseback, are thought to have been used to invoke the help of ancestors to cure illnesses. Using computed tomography scanning techniques, archaeologists revealed hidden channels within the objects which they think had a medicinal function, used for liquid ritual offerings. The figurines show people with congenital conditions including anencephaly - which still affects children in Africa today. Timothy Insoll, professor from the University of Manchester, says: \"Little is known about the people who made the figurines, who have no connection with Koma Land's current inhabitants. In fact, we know little in general about the past in this part of Ghana, because there are few historical sources before the late 19th century and oral traditions are scarce. But archaeology is unlocking some of the secrets of the past, and this project shows what can be achieved.\" He adds: \"We now know the figurines may have had ritual and medicinal functions and the mounds they were found in were perhaps medicine shrines, or places for disposal of material considered dangerous. We also know these people were farmers, who traded with cowry shells, used iron tools and lived in villages, with complex religious beliefs.\"; \u2022 Nottingham Trent University / Nottingham Using a humanoid robot as an educational tool could significantly improve engagement of children with severe intellectual disabilities, researchers have found. A study shows that pupils who interacted with the autonomous NAO robot had up to five times greater engagement than when they were in a standard classroom setting. David Brown, a professor at Nottingham Trent University, says: \"Human-robot interaction is an emerging field of research and these are really exciting initial results. Educating young people with intellectual disabilities presents different challenges due to their impaired understanding and reduced social skills.\" He adds: \"Engagement is thought to be the single best predictor of successful learning in children with intellectual disabilities and we have demonstrated here how robots can be used to increase engagement.\" The programmable NAO humanoid robot is more advanced than robots used in similar studies, with capabilities including speech, speech recognition, sitting, standing, walking, dancing and playing sound files.; \u2022 UCL / Southampton Researchers have developed a new kind of radar that can detect hidden surveillance equipment and explosives. The new system is able to distinguish targets, such as certain types of electronic circuits that may be used in explosive or espionage devices, including items such as pipes, drinks cans and nails, that may be mistaken for a genuine target by traditional radar and metal detectors. The new system is based on a unique sonar concept called twin inverted pulse sonar (TWIPS). TWIPS exploits the natural abilities of dolphins to process their sonar signals to distinguish between targets and clutter in bubbly water. Some dolphins have been observed to blow 'bubble nets' around schools of fish, which force the fish to cluster together, and their sonar would not work if they could not distinguish the fish from the bubbles. Tim Leighton, a professor from the University of Southampton, says: \"Certain electronic components can scatter radar signals nonlinearly if driven by a sufficiently strong radar signal, in contrast to naturally occurring objects which tend to scatter linearly. Such technology could be extended to other radiations, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and light detection and ranging (LIDAR), offering the possibility of early fire detection systems.\"; Would you like your university's research featured on the network?
