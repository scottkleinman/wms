Now a novelist with a foot in each camp wants to get Plato involved\tFor some time now the discipline of philosophy has been under something of an assault from the world of science. Four years ago Stephen Hawking announced that philosophy was \u201cdead\u201d. He was referring specifically to the philosophy of science, which he said was still bogged down in epistemological questions from which science had moved on.; But philosophy in general has increasingly been viewed as irrelevant by many scientists. It\u2019s a perspective that may be best summed up by the cosmologist Lawrence M Krauss, who has said: \u201cscience progresses and philosophy doesn\u2019t\u201d.; What\u2019s more, science has begun to progress into areas previously occupied by philosophy and the humanities at large. These incursions have not gone unchallenged.; Last year the debate flared up in a much-publicised intellectual spat between the cognitive psychologist Steven Pinker and the cultural critic Leon Wieseltier, who accused Pinker and his fellow scientists of practising \u201cscientism\u201d, a term he defined as \u201cthe translation of nonscientific discourse into scientific discourse\u201d.; \u201cIt is not for science to say whether science belongs in morality and politics and art,\u201d wrote Wieseltier. To which Pinker replied: \u201cIt\u2019s not for Leon Wieseltier to say where science belongs.\u201d; Now into the fray, mounting a spirited defence of philosophy, steps the novelist and philosopher Rebecca Newberger Goldstein. And the philosopher she has selected to show the subject\u2019s enduring relevance today is someone from the fifth century BC. In her new book, Plato at the Googleplex: Why Philosophy Won\u2019t Go Away, Goldstein draws on her talents both as an analytical thinker and a fiction writer to bring the founding father of philosophy into the 21st century.; Goldstein is the author of six novels, as well as studies of the mathematician Kurt G\u00f6del and the philosopher Baruch Spinoza. Her fiction often features philosophical or scientific elements \u2014 for example 2000\u2019s Properties of Light was a ghost story that took in quantum physics. She studied with the great philosopher of the mind Thomas Nagel at Princeton in the 1970s, where she gained her PhD. In 1996 she was awarded a \u201cgenius grant\u201d from the MacArthur fellows programme.; Goldstein is a small woman with big ideas. In person she is almost doll-like, with fine, tiny bones, an elegant high forehead and an easy smile. There\u2019s nothing about her manner \u2013 no lofty airs or scholarly posing \u2013 that suggests the formidable intellect at her disposal.; For not only is she able to deliver an exhilarating exposition of ancient Greek and Platonic thought, she also brings Plato back to life, by having him conduct a series of dialogues in current-day America. One moment he\u2019s at Google\u2019s headquarters holding forth on the limits of democratic wisdom, the next he\u2019s discussing child-rearing with an Amy Chua-type tiger mother, before taking on an abrasive Fox News presenter much like Bill O\u2019Reilly.; It\u2019s an interesting conceit that Goldstein handles with wit and a deft appreciation of Plato\u2019s thinking, though it does serve to make her book a curious hybrid. What gave her the idea?; \u201cWell, the idea of the dialogues came later. The germ of the book was that my background is scientific. I take science extremely seriously. I started in physics. But so many of my scientific friends have been attacking philosophy. The theoretical physicist and Nobel laureate Steven Weinberg said that philosophy asks questions until the empirical methodology comes along, and now it\u2019s coming to the terminus. And I believe this to be so very wrong.\u201d; One of the intriguing footnotes of the science v philosophy debate is that Goldstein is married to Pinker. They met because she was following a debate Pinker had been having with the late evolutionary biologist Stephen Jay Gould and, having bought Pinker\u2019s latest book, she looked \u201cGould\u201d up in the index. He wasn\u2019t there, but \u201cGoldstein\u201d was. It turned out that Pinker, who is also a celebrated linguist, had quoted her rare use of the past participle \u201cstridden\u201d to illustrate a grammatical point. She phoned him up. They took part in a philosophical-linguistic debate, and romance followed. \u201cYeah,\u201d she says, \u201cso we have a nerd love story.\u201d; Where does she stand in the argument between her husband and Wieseltier?; \u201cWell you know I\u2019m closer to Pinker\u2019s position,\u201d she says, clearly enjoying the scientific neutrality of using his surname. \u201cI think that Wieseltier lumps philosophy together with literature, and as much as I love both of them and participate in both of them, I think they\u2019re quite different.\u201d; The biggest difference, she maintains, is that philosophy makes progress, whereas literature may change but it doesn\u2019t, as it were, reach an improved understanding of the world. One of the things she seeks to show in her book is that, while Plato\u2019s influence is profound \u2013 she quotes Alfred North Whitehead\u2019s observation that European philosophy is a \u201cseries of footnotes to Plato\u201d \u2013 philosophy has nonetheless developed a lot since his time.; \u201cYou know, we can read Plato and see how much he gets wrong. If you look at the theory or forms or that kind of essentialism, we know that to be wrong now. So many of these ethical intuitions we know to be wrong, they\u2019re inconsistent. I think that\u2019s what philosophy is all about. It\u2019s trying to expand our coherence and that is a progress-making, knowledge-making endeavour.\u201d; It\u2019s obvious that in the sense of knowledge, philosophy has taken a great deal from scientific developments. And as scientific breakthroughs accelerate, it becomes increasingly difficult to keep up. But Goldstein believes the best of philosophers are doing exactly that.; \u201cThere are two kinds of questions,\u201d she says. \u201c\u2018What is?\u2019 and \u2018What matters?\u2019 And when it comes to descriptions of reality, ontology, I do think that science is our best answer, but I think it takes a philosophical argument to prove that. It\u2019s an epistemological argument. You have to argue for scientific realism against instrumentalism, and that\u2019s all philosophical stuff. But the upshot is that science provides the best description of what is: it\u2019s energy and matter and genes and neurons. That\u2019s what reality consists of. But the realm of philosophy is in trying to reconcile what science is telling us \u2013 which is why philosophers have to know science \u2013 with other intuitions we have, without which we can\u2019t make sense of our lives. Like, for example, personal identity. Is there any room for that, given what neuroscience is telling us? Or questions of agency and accountability.\u201d; But philosophy, she contends, has more to take from science than just ontological facts. It could also learn from the way science writing has made itself accessible to non-specialists. \u201cPhilosophers have not done it as much. I think I have an explanation for that and I think it comes from Plato. I find the seeds of a lot of things in Plato. It comes from the Protagoras [one of Plato\u2019s dialogues].\u201d; She recounts how Plato explains that there some things people can be told by others and they accept, but some things which threaten their sense of themselves.; \u201cThe questions that philosophers deal in \u2013 what is the life that matters, when are actions justified \u2013 these are questions that every human being has a stake in and everyone feels themselves to be an expert on. So to say to someone \u2018I\u2019m a philosopher and I know about right and wrong in a way that you can\u2019t possibly know\u2019, you are demeaning their humanity. If Brian Greene says \u2018I know more about string theory\u2019, everyone says, \u2018Fine, you\u2019re the expert\u2019. If philosophers say, \u2018I know more about the life that matters\u2019, people are not going to take it. So you have to find a way to do it, and it\u2019s very tricky. Not many philosophers manage to do that.\u201d; However, if philosophy often has a tendency to slip into self-referential obscurity, it would be wrong, says Goldstein, to characterise the work that philosophers do as divorced from the real world. Some scientist take the view that since what used to be called \u201cnatural philosophy\u201d became physics, the remaining rump of philosophy has had nothing worthwhile to say. Indeed, people like Krauss argue that there is no longer much real difference between philosophy and theology.; Traditionally, the second philosophical question (\u201cWhat matters?\u201d) has been dealt with by two very different systems of thought, the Hebrew and the Hellenic, the monotheistic and the secular. Both originated around the same time, in what Goldstein calls the \u201cnormative explosion\u201d of the \u201caxial age\u201d. Normative, in philosophical terms, means questions that concern what we \u201cought\u201d to do. And axial age is the German philosopher Karl Jaspers\u2019s term to describe the period between 800-200 BC in which a series of moral outlooks took shape in different parts of the world.; The two systems have provided the cornerstones of European civilisation. But for all the noise religion continues to make, we live in secular times. Our ways of thinking about what is right \u2013 whether it\u2019s the relations between the sexes, freedom of the individual or the proper role of the state \u2013 have been shaped by the Platonic means of inquiry, a system of reasoning that seeks to unearth bias and contradictions, rather than accept directives handed down on tablets of stone.; \u201cAs religious as the Greek society was, when it came to his question of mattering, they approached it secularly,\u201d says Goldstein.; She believes we undervalue this secular tradition and the Greeks\u2019 part in it. Goldstein is well placed to make this judgment, having been brought up in an ultra-orthodox Jewish household, albeit one that allowed promiscuous reading. Her brother is an orthodox rabbi. It was books that provided her route to atheism, in particular Bertrand Russell\u2019s Why I Am Not a Christian. \u201cMy parents didn\u2019t mind my reading that,\u201d she quips, \u201cbecause they didn\u2019t care if I wasn\u2019t a Christian. But he destroyed all the arguments for the existence of God, including the moral ones, and I got what he was saying. I felt it all fall into place and just felt a tremendous relief.\u201d; If Russell opened her eyes to what matters, a more problematic related question she touches on in the book is \u201cWho matters?\u201d For Plato, slaves and peasants clearly didn\u2019t get much of a look in. But it\u2019s in the expansion of mattering that Goldstein sees moral progress, which she attributes in no small part to the philosophers who followed in the Athenian\u2019s wake.; Goldstein does not share the view popularised by John Gray that moral progress is an illusion.; \u201cPart of the notion of being a moral person is you account for yourself, you give grounds for yourself, for your behaviour. You are prepared to defend your position. But the other aspect of that is, to whom are you prepared to defend it? To whom are you accountable? And one of the ways to actually see moral progress is in the expanding circle of those to whom we feel accountable.\u201d; Plato, as she points out, felt accountable only to a small group of aristocratic Greek landowners. Famed for his concept of a philosopher king, the renowned philosopher is often seen today as an unapologetic elitist. Yet Goldstein is at pains to show that he was always open to persuasion and that his main concern was to establish what constituted a good life for all citizens \u2013 though of course, that was itself a limited group in ancient Athens.; But what about in our democratic age? Does everyone matter the same? If the aim is, as Plato maintained, to realise our best selves, does getting closer to our best selves mean that we matter more?; \u201cSome people contribute more than others,\u201d she says. \u201cSome people are helping other people towards their own mattering, towards their own flourishing, more than others. I don\u2019t think on the fundamental ethical level that means they matter more.\u201d; So the charity worker and the child killer matter the same amount?; \u201cYou know, it is such a crying shame that this person is squandering his life, and causing others pain, but it is a crying shame that he is squandering his life because his life matters.\u201d; This strikes me as a classic example of a philosophical belief, a moral position that is arrived at through a system of reasoning and intellectual coherence. But it is nonetheless a belief. We can\u2019t prove that everyone matters, or that everyone matters the same amount. In this sense, Krauss has a point when he compares philosophy to theology. Yet surely it\u2019s better to arrive at a belief through deep thought and rational analysis than by accepting it is a received article of faith.; Goldstein argues that philosophy can improve us as human beings, not in a self-help sense \u2013 although she recommends reading philosophy as a means of contemplating the important issues in life \u2013 but as a system of transferring intellectual intuition into popularly held feelings.; Look at any major social breakthrough, she says, and the chances are you can trace it back to a philosopher. It starts out as an intellectual argument, and only much later does it enter the mainstream of society, and then it becomes so everyday as to become invisible. This is why, she believes, we don\u2019t appreciate philosophy\u2019s progress \u2013 because it\u2019s constantly absorbed and normalised by changing mores.; She cites as an example of philosophy\u2019s improving influence the 16th-century philosopher Jean Bodin, who argued against slavery as far back as 1576. But as pope Paul III is understood to have done the same four decades earlier, I\u2019m not sure this is the strongest case for philosophy as the incubator of social reform.; But what of the future? What current practices and behaviours will generations to come look back on with disbelief?; \u201cI think the way we treat prisoners,\u201d she replies. \u201cI think solitary confinement is something that we\u2019re going to look back on with horror. And factory farming. I\u2019m not saying that everybody\u2019s going to be a vegetarian or a vegan, but we will be horrified by the terrible amount of suffering that we\u2019re inflicting.\u201d; If so, she says we should thank Peter Singer, the Australian philosopher whose 1975 book Animal Liberation first stated the case for man\u2019s inhumanity to animals. \u201cI remember when it seemed crazy. But then other philosophers started talking, paying attention, criticising it, and it starts impinging on people\u2019s emotions, it goes outside the realm of philosophy. It becomes a social movement.\u201d; It\u2019s unlikely that Plato would have thought too much about animal exploitation, although Ovid believed he was a vegetarian. But he would have appreciated the notion of an enlightened philosopher who is freed from a cave of false perception to envision a different and perhaps more accurate reality.; In the end, as Goldstein\u2019s book eloquently argues, science and philosophy fulfil two different but complementary roles. Science may be able to tell us if and how animals suffer pain. But it requires philosophy to explain if and why that\u2019s wrong.",
