It has been found in the silt in the lead coffins and stone sarcophagi from the most elaborate burials in the 3rd and early 4th centuries in Roman Britain.; The Roman Lady, whose sealed coffin was opened live on television at the Museum of London soon after it was found near Spitalfields market, was among the elite buried with precious resins, including mastic and slightly cheaper pine. In Greek and Roman culture the intoxicating perfume of the incense was believed to rise straight to the gods, and its fabulous cost made it a suitably grand offering. But it also had practical purposes as a natural antiseptic and anti-microbial agent, and to mask the smell of a rotting corpse.; The team of archaeologists behind the discovery, led by Rhea Brettell from the University of Bradford, has found tantalising hints that frankincense, mentioned in ancient texts on burial rites, may have been used far earlier in Britain.; Since their initial work – published on Thursday in the Journal of Archaeological Science – Brettell has found what she described as “an almost solid lump of pure frankincense” in a cremation from a much earlier Mersea Island barrow, excavated in 1912. The corpse had been cremated and the ashes packed carefully into a beautiful green glass urn, with a lump of precious frankincense dropped in. It can only have been an offering to accompany the dead as it would have had no practical function.; “To be honest, I was astonished,” Brettell said.; Most of the pieces the team found were too small to be seen with the naked eye and were only identified through molecular analysis of the residue from the burials.; “I’ve always been interested in the silts, which frustratingly are often all that remains in these burials as modern material washes in, washing out the original contents. I recently helped excavate an apparently intact coffin which was literally full to the brim with modern silt.; “I knew that frankincense and other resins had been found in burials on the continent, where preservation is often much better, so I thought it was worth looking for them here but realistically I thought we had very little chance.”; She believes the resins were packed into the folds of the clothing or bindings of the dead person, but the Mersea Island find proves that it was also used at an earlier period when cremation – which would usually have destroyed such evidence – was more common.; The elaborate later burials, with the bodies of the rich laid into lead coffins and stone sarcopagi, had a much better chance of preserving the resins and the dead were more likely to have mourners who could afford such opulent offerings.; Her team tested samples from burials in Dorset, Wiltshire, London and York. Of the 49 analysed, four showed traces of frankincense and 10 of cheaper pine resins.; They also found mastic, another antibacterial tree resin renowned since ancient times as a breath freshener, which was also coveted and hugely expensive. Mastic is still prized and widely used as a flavouring, particularly in desserts across the eastern Mediterranean.; Carl Heron, professor of archaeological sciences at Bradford, said: “It is remarkable that the first evidence for the use of frankincense in Britain should come from such seemingly unpromising samples, yet our analysis demonstrates that traces of these exotic resins can survive for over 1,700 years in what others would reject as dirt.”; Brettell’s work, in collaboration with specialists at the Anglo-Saxon Laboratory in York, the Museum of London and the universities of Bamberg and Bordeaux, was funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council.; “I’m now thinking when did this start and how long did it continue?” she said.; Brettell hopes to secure funding to look at earlier and later burials, and is intrigued by medieval legends of the discovery of the bodies of saints, found incorrupt and sweet smelling – exactly the effect you might hope to achieve if you had a lot of money and could get your hands on enough frankincense.
