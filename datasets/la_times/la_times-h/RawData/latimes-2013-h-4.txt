12/2/2013	Getty founder's award scheduled;Harold Williams and Nancy Englander will be inaugural recipients for their leadership with the Getty Trust.	On Monday night, the Getty will present its inaugural J. Paul Getty Founder's Award to Harold Williams and Nancy Englander, who have helped lead the J. Paul Getty Trust -- and envision its future -- since 1981.;The award will be given out annually to honorees internationally in the areas represented at the Getty -- art, research, conservation and philanthropy.;It's fitting that the first award should go to the two people who gave intellectual structure and physical form to Mr. Getty's vision," Getty President James Cuno said in a statement. "And [two people] of whom one can say, as of no one else, 'they built the Getty and thereby changed the course of museum practice, the conservation of art, and the study of art history.';Williams is the former dean of UCLA's Anderson School of Management and was head of the Securities and Exchange Commission under President Jimmy Carter. In 1981, he was chosen by the Getty's Board of Trustees to lead the trust and help determine how it would grow and develop.;The National Endowments for the Arts and Humanities' Englander and Leilani Lattin Duke were brought on by Williams shortly after to help chart the future of the Getty, which by 1982 was defined as an interdisciplinary center for learning and an art and art history resource. That, of course, included the Richard Meier-designed Getty Center, which opened in 1997.;It's deeply gratifying to see the Getty continue to fulfill the promise we envisioned," Williams said. "We are honored to have helped conceive of the modern Getty, and to watch it take shape.;--;deborah.vankin@latimes.com
