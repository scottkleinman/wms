4/24/2014	LETTERS	Science for all students;Re "Are we losing the tech race?," Opinion, April 20;Michael Teitelbaum presents common-sense advice about majoring in science.;He echoes what proponents of the liberal arts have been saying for years: that it is not enough to specialize in one area of expertise, and that science students must gain broad intellectual skills developed through the humanities, arts and social sciences.;However, I disagree with Teitelbaum's assessment that science education for non-science majors should be limited to K-12.;If science is important to an informed citizenry, as he asserts, then surely he should see value in such study throughout one's undergraduate years. Business majors benefit from exploring the science of environmental sustainability, sociology majors should build expertise in the biology of aging, and students in any discipline should develop greater understanding of scientific methods.;College graduates, no matter their majors, need a knowledge of the natural sciences that is enhanced by the breadth and depth of education gained throughout the college years.;Sharon Herzberger;Whittier;The writer is president of Whittier College.;Teitelbaum may be correct that we have plenty of scientists in certain (though not all) fields. But the larger problem is that we have allowed the non-scientists in the general public to fall into ignorance and superstition.;When too many people refuse to accept evolution, decline vaccinations, deny global warming, believe in the magic of an herbal pill and slurp up the myths of pseudoscience, I fear for the future of the nation.;Until we return to teaching critical thinking in our elementary schools, the situation will be hopeless.;Geoff Kuenning;Claremont;--;Koch brothers vs. solar industry;Re "The right takes aim at the solar industry," April 20;The vast sums of money used by the Koch brothers and their ilk originated from average Americans fueling their vehicles and powering their homes.;Billions of dollars are sucked out of our economy by those who want us to keep using carbon-based energy. The use of oil, coal and natural gas has massive external costs that are not paid by the end user. This is the reason government regulators are trying to level the playing field by providing reasonable incentives for solar energy.;States that fight these regulations will end up sending billions of dollars from their residents to these industries, reducing the cash available for other needs. They will continue polluting their environment and sickening their populace, costing themselves even more.;Sunshine is free, and once you've made the capital expenditure to install your solar system, you get free energy for the rest of your life.;Paul Scott;Santa Monica;Surprisingly, the one word that never appeared in the article was the ever-recurring, variable-length phenomenon known as "night." This is the period when solar cells refuse to provide electrical energy to power the appliances that operate after the sun goes down.;For total power company independence, solar users could purchase, say, two battery units from Tesla Motors for several grand each and install them in their garages. Or they could purchase and install a fossil-fueled generator to bridge the night-time gap.;Or not.;Let's hope the power company stays in business.;Gordon Osborne;Woodland Hills;So there you have it: No pretense of ideological differences or the illusion of offering a superior plan for the betterment of the country and society as a whole. No, it's just plain old naked influence-peddling through huge cash donations to pandering politicians, aimed solely at denying progress and keeping the shortsighted moneymaking status quo.;It's not about competitiveness and progress, it's about selfishness and short-term greed.;I often wonder what people of inherited wealth like Charles and David Koch tell their children and grandchildren when they ask why we are losing our competitive edge and spiraling into a polluted and resource-ravaged world.;Bob Hoffman;Long Beach;The Koch brothers and anti-tax activist Grover Norquist argue that Arizonans who have invested in solar energy should pay the grid owners $50 to $100 a month, far more than the state-allowed $5 a month.;The Koch brothers and Norquist have obviously benefited greatly from a country and government that provides the world's most sophisticated and expensive military and defense organizations, an education system that is still the envy of the world, and infrastructure that keeps things moving and working.;Why can't they understand the logic of their own argument when it comes to paying taxes on investment income?;John Eaglesham;Long Beach;--;Not all lies are created equal;Re "Lying is free speech too," Editorial, April 20;As a free-speech advocate, I would probably agree with your editorial opposing the criminalization of false political speech if politics was a level playing field.;Unfortunately, it isn't.;Imagine if the anti-abortion Susan B. Anthony List -- with millions of dollars contributed by corporate ideologues -- was able to purchase massive amounts of television and newspaper advertising falsely accusing a candidate of voting for "taxpayer-funded abortions.;Yes, in an ideal world, the remedy for speech that is false is speech that is true. But the speech that is true would be buried by an avalanche of corporate-funded lies.;As the saying goes, tell a lie often enough and people will begin to believe it. Do we really want a political system in which lies are on an equal footing with the truth, and liars can hide behind our Constitution?;Steve Mehlman;Beaumont;Not all speech -- especially speech that can endanger someone -- is protected by the Constitution.;Telling lies about a person can harm his reputation and perhaps even his mental health. It may be true that one could bring suit against the liar, but that is not always practical. Meanwhile, serious damage can be inflicted by a liar.;Usually I agree with your editorials, this time, I respectfully do not.;David Coulson;Huntington Beach;--;Guidance that parents can use;Re "Giving parents extra skills," Column, April 19;I was happy to read about Parent-Child Interaction Therapy, or PCIT, in Sandy Banks' column, and that Los Angeles County is planning an expansion of this service.;As a social worker who has worked with families striving to reunify after child-protection intervention, I have witnessed the benefit PCIT can yield in teaching essential parenting skills and empowering parents with tools to use when interacting with their children.;Clients who have been fortunate enough to participate in PCIT reported that it was extremely helpful to have the guidance of a therapist as they were working with their child in real time, instead of trying to apply what they had learned in a parenting class on their own.;This is a beneficial service whose expansion is welcome news to those who want to see families succeed and thrive.;Deanne McCollum;Riverside;--;Knowing what you're voting on;Re "Oddball bills stand out in congressional session," April 22;Pity that some of our congressional representatives are so vapid that a special bill had to be written for them to do the right thing. The Read the Bills Act shouldn't be necessary, but it should be passed.;Any school kid knows that he has to read the assignment. Yet it seems some of our representatives think showing up to vote on unread material is enough. Not so.;You take an oath of office and you do the job. Plain and simple: Read the bill, and then vote.;Jacquelyn Heebner;Encino;Illustration;Caption: PHOTO: (no caption), PHOTOGRAPHER:Alex Nabaum For The Times
