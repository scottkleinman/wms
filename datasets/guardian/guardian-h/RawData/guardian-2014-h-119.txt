Monday 2 June 2014 11.01 EDT	A bright future for Kazakhstan's NGOs	High rates of volunteering suggest potential for Kazakhstan's civil society, but the country is still shaking off the Soviet past	Although Kazakhstan's civil society has had low levels of political engagement and general tendency to be politically apathetic, Kazakhs have high propensity to engage in community work. In the recent Civil Society Index (CSI), 19.7% of respondents said they volunteer for at least one social organisation; and 27.9% engage in social activities.; Meruert Makhmutova, CSI co-author, says: "Public movements, largely driven by what was defined as CSOs [civil society organisations], played a vital part in its transition to democracy. Environmental movements seeking to close nuclear test sites diversified into democratic movements, opening up the political scene and serving as the basis for the first political parties after independence."; The CSI, however, cites a lack of a culture of philanthropy or corporate social responsibility. As Alexander Shukhov, former editor of the country's largest weekly, the Caravan, has said: "This is a heritage of the Soviet times gone deep in our mentality."; The weakest point of this aspect is sustainability of human resources. Income inequality, large numbers of vulnerable groups and poor economic and social conditions in rural regions remain a challenge in Kazakhstan; and it is likely that the low standard of living averts people from engaging more in civil society activities. And yet there is every reason to be optimistic.; At the Asian Development Bank's annual meeting in Astana this month, some 3,000 delegates from across the globe discussed regional connectivity, development strategies and green growth to keep up with the demands of the changing needs of Asia-Pacific. Themed The Silk Road – Connecting Asia with the Changing World, Kazakhstan not only snapped the opportunity to showcase its rich history and bullish attitude towards progress; it asserted its political and geographical position as strategic route between a booming Asia and global market.; "Astana symbolises the country's remarkable progress since independence," said ADB's president, Takehiko Nakao. Nakao and the rest of the ADB are fairly positive in rethinking the strategies of engagement in tackling poverty and governance issues in the region. Because as ADB strives to stay relevant in a region poised to attain full development by 2020, it has to reinvent its engagement with its member countries.; Nowhere is this better announced than in Astana. In what ADB staff call "revolutionary", Nakao and Kazakh's prime minister, Karim Massimov, signed a US$5.5bn partnership to tap into his country's sovereign wealth fund to support its industrial policy, small and medium enterprises, and financial sector.; The rest of Central Asia can look to this type of co-financing and government support to be ultimately replicated across Kazakhstan's relatively lesser-developed neighbours. "The co-financing framework in Kazakhstan is something we hope to replicate in other countries that have a similar economic profile," said Matthew Westfall, Kazakhstan country director.; The annual meeting focused on moving beyond the largely contested millennium development goals and into a post-2015 agenda – when Asia's developing economies would have risen above poverty – something both local and international NGOs do and will not let off their radar. "The choice for Kazakhstan to host this significant global event made years ago highlights the fact that despite the ensuing situation in Ukraine, there is a lot going on elsewhere in the former Soviet world," said Gerard Lyons, a London-based international economist.; The big picture of Kazakh civil society is, however cautiously, looking bright. The CSI concluded with a list of opportunities for Kazakhstan to exploit; including sufficient internal governance structures, being generally open to intra-sectoral networking and information exchange; and the tendency to be sensitive to marginalised social groups.; Now, with increasing interest and watchfulness towards Central Asia, CSOs too must do more: they will need to educate the society more about NGOs' hard responsibilities, rights and relations with the state and the private sector, both at home and in school.; After all, as Miras Daulenov, international law and international relations chair of the Kazakh Humanities and Law University, suggests his country's development into a dynamic modern state with better living standards will only be possible on the basis of activating its human potential and strengthening civil society. The way forward will need commitment from the government as well as from the civil society and the donor community to overcome existing challenges.; If we are to be guided by the ADB's advocacy for civil society engagement and participatory approach towards public sector deals with its member countries, we can be assured that Kazakh civil society, too, will gain a better hand at pushing not only for development strategies but also for policy reforms allowing for a stronger [civil society] engagement. The event in Astana was only the first wave of reminder – both for Nazarbayev and the Kazakh civil society: what happens or what its young movers do next to redefine the country's future history will require leaving their or their parents' comfort zone and ultimately the Soviet past.; Read more stories like this:; • 'Local people are best-placed to tell their own stories' • Societies can't be inclusive without equal access to justice • Seven women to watch in global politics; Join the community of global development professionals and experts.
