We should too, or we face a future where the study of literature or art becomes a luxury available to the rich alone\tWhen the government raised tuition fees, it made me angry and thirsty for political change. It felt as if they were taking away from people from poor backgrounds or on a low income the chance for social justice. The meaning of education changed from something that is inherently good and improving for society, to simply a means to being employable. Degrees became a transactional process about exchanging a qualification for money. That\u2019s why, if I could choose any government policy, I would choose to abolish tuition fees.; University is often seen as a middle-class pursuit. Historically, middle- and upper-class people gained an intellectual education, while working-class people were expected to learn practical trades. So when you talk about abolishing tuition fees, people often think you\u2019re only interested in the middle class. But free universal education is good for everybody.; In 1999, Tony Blair said he wanted at least 50% of people under 30 to get a degree. Although this made higher education more open to people of all incomes, it came a year after New Labour introduced tuition fees \u2013 and with them, debt. Everybody deserves the opportunity to learn about the world without having to worry about being saddled with debt afterwards. You shouldn\u2019t have to pay \u00a350,000 for the privilege of exploring your own humanity \u2013 and that\u2019s what education is when it\u2019s at its best.; The rise in tuition fees in 2010 has affected the people most able to benefit from but least able to access higher education. A 2013 study for the Independent Commission on Fees showed that working-class boys were being put off applying for university because of a rise in fees. The government should abolish tuition fees now to take away economic barriers that are a deterrent to accessing university. But it should also introduce a mentoring scheme to positively encourage people to recognise that they have a right to higher education, whatever their backgrounds.; When I meet teenagers through my charity Arts Emergency, they tell me about the pressure they feel to opt out of an arts degree in order to \u201cpay the bills\u201d. Ten years ago, when I was at university, I found the notion of debt daunting, and it made it hard for me to choose to study English, which had no obvious career path. But I\u2019m glad I did it because it taught me how to think creatively and independently, and to understand the world\u2019s complexities. Those abilities have coloured my whole life since, and they\u2019ll stay with me always. University gave me a completely different life that I would never have had otherwise: it allowed me to meet people I would never have met; it expanded my horizons; and it gave me inroads to comedy I could never have found on my own. But the increase in tuition fees, coinciding with the slashing of funding to the humanities, turns education into something purely functional. As a society, it feels as if we\u2019ve taken a step back in time \u2013 to when studying literature, philosophy or art was a luxury only for those who could afford it.; I still remember Nick Clegg dismissing student protesters by saying: \u201cI would feel ashamed if I didn\u2019t deal with the way that the world is, not simply dream of the way the world I would like it to be.\u201d If our politicians aren\u2019t dreaming of making the world better, then what are they there for? For me, idealism is the biggest reason to be political \u2013 because you want the world to be better and you believe it can be better.; Free education isn\u2019t a distant dream: it\u2019s happening elsewhere in the world right now. Germany has just scrapped tuition fees for everybody, even international students . The senator Dorothee Stapelfeldt said the move was made because tuition fees were \u201cunjust\u201d and deterred students with difficult economic circumstances from going to university. Brazil also has public universities where education is free.; I want to dream of delightful possibilities for Britain too, so people can be nourished by education and learn to think critically because they live in a society that understands that those things are intrinsically important \u2013 and by extension, that people are important. If we abolished fees, we would change our values as a whole, and we\u2019d build something better.; \u2022 Josie Long is speaking at Class Conference 2014 on 1 November",
