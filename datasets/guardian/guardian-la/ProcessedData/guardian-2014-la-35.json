  "content": "Thursday 16 October 2014 10.00 EDT\tSleater-Kinney: Start Together review \u2013 a seven-album box set of punk power\tSleater-Kinney began as an abrasive riot-grrrl side project but ended up as one of America\u2019s most acclaimed rock bands \u2013 and they still sound ferociously great today\tThese days, Sleater-Kinney\u2019s two main protagonists, Carrie Brownstein and Corin Tucker are, respectively, a comedy writer and actor whose US TV show, Portlandia, has been garlanded with Emmy nominations; and a mother of two, married to film-maker Lance Bangs, who occasionally makes \u201cmiddle-aged mom records\u201d with the Corin Tucker Band. It seems fair to say that is not an outcome anyone who bought Sleater-Kinney\u2019s 1995 debut album probably envisaged. This was a 22-minute-long blast of righteous gay fury, released on queercore label Chainsaw: amid the distorted guitars and screaming and songs in which anyone in possession of a penis was told where to get off, there weren\u2019t a lot of ROFLs, Emmy-winning or otherwise.; But then, surely few people who bought Sleater-Kinney\u2019s debut album envisaged the trio becoming one of the most acclaimed and revered rock bands in America \u2013 befitting a lavishly packaged seven-album box set nearly a decade after they went on \u201cindefinite hiatus\u201d. Sleater-Kinney began life as a side project by members of riot grrrl bands Heavens to Betsy and Excuse 17, and that\u2019s exactly what their debut sounds like. If anything, the anger feels more potent now than in 1995, when dozens of other bands were saying more or less the same thing in more or less the same way, but the music is interesting largely as an index of the kind of influences that were floating around the US alt-rock underground at the time: Tucker\u2019s vocals are Poly Styrene after three years at a liberal arts college, Be Yr Mama sounds like Sonic Youth, Don\u2019t Think You Wanna could have been released on Rough Trade in 1979.; That should have been that, but something happened in the year between Sleater-Kinney and its follow-up, Call the Doctor. Perhaps it was as prosaic as Tucker and Brownstein quitting their other bands and concentrating their energies, but whatever it was, it pulled their songs and sound into focus. Their influences were suddenly marshalled into something entirely their own, simultaneously tough and intricate. Tucker and Brownstein were horrified when Spin magazine revealed they were a couple, but it\u2019s tempting to say you could have guessed just by listening: their guitar lines and, increasingly, their vocals wound around each other until you couldn\u2019t tell them apart. Tucker, meanwhile, subtly altered her vocal style, retaining all the power, but ceasing to make you involuntarily grit your teeth every time she approached a microphone. Their debut feels entirely a product of its era, but now they seemed to be hitting on something more eternal: \u201cI\u2019m not waiting \u2019til I grow up,\u201d ran one chorus, a perfect summation of the impulse behind all punk rock.; From then on, Sleater-Kinney developed a momentum that felt unstoppable, refining rather than radically altering their sound on each new album. \u201cI find it kind of ridiculous when people fear the future,\u201d Tucker told one journalist. \u201cWe are the ones who are going to create it.\u201d 1998\u2019s Dig Me Out came in a cover that paid homagto the Kinks and expanded their sound, introducing both more hooks and Janet Weiss, a more strident and straightforward drummer than her predecessors, without compromising the band\u2019s individuality or power: One More Hour detailed the collapse of Tucker and Brownstein\u2019s relationship with agonising candour, the pair\u2019s vocals crashing into each other as if making public their final argument. Its follow-up, The Hot Rock, was darker and more introspective, but still had the ability to knock the unsuspecting listener off their feet, as demonstrated by the surging power of opener Start Together.; They seemed like a band that barely put a step wrong, although one might tremblingly suggest that writing songs complaining about the music press is always going to seem a little peevish if you\u2019re on the receiving end of the kind of blanket critical acclaim that greeted Sleater-Kinney\u2019s every album: Time magazine called them America\u2019s greatest rock band, Rolling Stone claimed they were \u201cthe best American punk band ever\u201d. Meanwhile, Esquire \u2013 not a magazine noted for its interest in queer theory or third-wave feminism or indeed many of the other knotty topics that Sleater-Kinney\u2019s lyrics touched on \u2013 went for \u201cthe best band in the world\u201d, which is perhaps testament to the trio\u2019s ability to address those topics without ever leaving the listener feeling like they\u2019d been at a lecture. They could certainly do things that no other artist seemed capable of doing. Plenty of people tried to formulate a musical response to 9/11, not least Bruce Springsteen and Neil Young, but none of them came up with anything quite as compelling as 2002\u2019s album One Beat: its mood shifted from fear to fury to an unexpected playfulness (\u201cShake a tail feather for love and peace\u201d, offered the Motown-influenced Step Aside) without ever seeming trite or false.; Their momentum didn\u2019t slacken: Sleater-Kinney didn\u2019t sound like a band grinding to a halt on 2004\u2019s The Woods. If anything, they sounded more alive than ever, Tucker\u2019s voice straining to make itself heard over the crashing guitars and drums, everything coated with a layer of crackling distortion by producer Dave Fridmann, the trio boldly venturing into territories that would have presumably been verboten under riot grrrl\u2019s ascetic musical aesthetic: Let\u2019s Call It Love lasted 11 minutes, the last five of them consumed entirely by a ferocious, feedback-heavy guitar solo. They went out, anger intact, lambasting alternative rock\u2019s increasingly overwhelming obsession with the past. \u201cYou come around sounding 1972 \u2013 you did nothing new with 1972,\u201d snarled Tucker on Entertain, adding pointedly: \u201cWhere\u2019s the \u2018fuck you\u2019?\u201d As Start Together proves, that was never a question anyone would need to ask Sleater-Kinney.\n",
