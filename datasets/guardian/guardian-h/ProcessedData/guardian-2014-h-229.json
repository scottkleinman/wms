Formal and \u201cuniversal\u201d training for Muslim religious leaders, it says, will discourage extremism, lead to greater integration and put imams on a level with clergy from other main religions.; However, Marco Ventura, a professor of law and religion at the University of Leuven in Belgium, who has seen the report, said it raised the controversial question of government meddling in religion. \u201cThis would be state intervention that reached to the heart of the Muslim community and affected its internal organisation,\u201d he said.; \u201cIn many ways, though, it represents a return to 19th-century ideas of involving the state in religious training with the aim of modernisation. In those days, the targets were Jews and Christians. The document itself makes the point that there are precedents for what is being suggested.\u201d; French officials estimate there are 1,800 imams working in the country, only 25-30% of whom hold French nationality. Of the 1,800, only 800 at most are paid part- or full-time. Almost all of those receiving a salary are from Turkey, Algeria and Morocco and have been trained in their countries.; The report, by Prof Francis Messner, an Islamic studies expert and director of research at France\u2019s National Centre for Scientific Research, suggests the introduction of more degree courses at higher education colleges. The course syllabus should include secular civic studies, humanities, science and other religions, it says. Diplomas in Islamic theology from private colleges would be officially recognised only if they included these subjects.; Messner said existing theological instruction for priests, pastors and rabbis had set a precedent. This teaching is intended to \u201cavoid the creation of counter-societies preaching the supremacy of divine law over human law \u2026 [and] encourage the education of a tolerant, enlightened clergy \u2026 [that is] tolerant of other religious traditions or other forms of thought\u201d.; The report recognises the difficulty of imposing training on Islamic preachers and giving them an official status because of the lack of a structured clergy in Islam, and the \u201cmultitude of associations or federations that are sometimes under the control of foreign states\u201d.; \u201cThe absence of a status defined by the religion itself, has produced the multiplying of self-proclaimed religious leaders.\u201d; The report adds: The report recognises that since 2008, France has created a \u201cwell-structured civic- and civil-training network for religious leaders, particularly Muslim religious leaders\u201d, but says there must be more universities offering religious diplomas as well as centres of excellence in Islamic humanities and social sciences.; \u201cThe obtaining of a visa for foreign religious leaders wanting to work in France could be made conditional on their agreeing to study for a university diploma and, consequently, proving their good command of French,\u201d the report suggests. \u201cThe recruitment of chaplains in the army, hospitals and prison establishments, who are public agents paid by the authorities, should be reserved for those candidates holding an university degree in civil and civic studies.\u201d; Ventura said the report would trigger a debate on whether a neutral state should go so far. \u201cBut it is not clear whether the Muslims themselves will be opposed to these proposals. In Morocco and Turkey, for example, they are used to the idea of the state intervening actively in the affairs of the mosque.; \u201cThe proposals could also have implications for Christians \u2013 churches who bring in priests and vicars from abroad would presumably be subject to the same rules.\u201d; In a letter commissioning the report last year, French interior and education ministers wrote: \u201cIt is not intended in any way to enter into the theological content of the programmes which, in our republic, is exclusively the responsibility of the religious authorities.\u201d; The report comes as France investigates two Frenchmen believed to be involved in the horrific beheadings of 18 Syrian soldiers and the US aid worker Peter Kassig. Maxime Hauchard, 22,from Normandy, and Micha\u00ebl Dos Santos, 22, from Champigny-sur-Marne, were named by the French interior ministry after being identified in the Islamic State (Isis) propaganda video of the murders released on Sunday. Intelligence officers, however, believe the two jihadis were radicalised through the internet.; An Isis film released this week \u2013 part of an intensifying propaganda to recruit foreign fighters \u2013 showed three French nationals burning their passports and calling on Muslims in France to join the group in Syria and Iraq or carry out attacks at home.; The interior ministry released figures this week stating that 1,132 French citizens were implicated in Isis, either as would-be fighters or suppliers of false papers. There are believed to be about 376 French Isis fighters, while dozens more are believed to be on their way or to have returned.; The interior minister, Bernard Cazeneuve, said 138 suspected Islamists in France were under investigation or in prison and had been neutralised.",
