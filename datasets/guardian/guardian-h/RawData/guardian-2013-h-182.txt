Tuesday 13 August 2013 03.00 EDT	The Tartan army masses at Wembley, with Scottish confidence on the rise	Scotland's football team will hit the Wembley turf on Wednesday to play England, famously known as the 'auld enemy', but which country is feeling strongest?	Tomorrow evening, the Tartan Army will descend on Wembley in west London - complete with massed pipers, kilts, blue and white faces and fake ginger wigs - to again stage the oldest international fixture in football, after a 14 year absence.; More than 20,000 fans are due to arrive in west London to reenact what was once the most highly-charged fixtures in British sport, the annual home nations match between England and Scotland. But times have changed, and so has the game, and the fans.; In 1977, the year of the Queen's jubilee, the intensity of that rivalry and the sport's reputation for hooliganism were underlined when Scotland fans tore up Wembley's pitch and brought down a goal mouth in celebration at a 2-1 victory over England. In 1989, the annual fixtures ended, much to the dismay of the Scots.; This week's/next week's match, a friendly to mark the English Football Association's 150th anniversary, is the first contest between the two nations since Scotland beat England 1-0 at Wembley in a European championship qualifying game 14 years ago (it was typically a face-saving victory: England won on aggregate, after an earlier 2-0 victory at Hampden).; First played in 1872 (for an excellent history of this fixture, read Scott Murray in the Observer here), this game takes place at a critical time for the UK, barely a year before Scotland votes on whether to leave the United Kingdom.; Leading historians believe that constitutional battle will "sharpen" the rivalry at this game for fans on both sides. But this time, believes Professor Tom Devine, the preeminent expert on modern Scottish history, it is the English who have greatest reason to feel insecure.; In the 1970s, the Scots were rowdy, boozing and at times violent because of an underlying insecurity influenced partly by the collapse in Scotland's heavy industries, a rise in nationalism, and an inferiority complex and "chippiness" attached to their much larger neighbour, Devine says.; Since then, the Tartan army has earned a reputation as one of the friendliest, most peaceable travelling supports of any international team: the supporters won a fair play award in 2001 after a world cup fixture in Belgium. And this reputation, perhaps counter-intuitively, has been cemented even while the national team's failures on the pitch saw it plummet down the world rankings. (Scotland has just jumped up 24 places to 50th in the latest rankings, after beating Croatia in June.); This time, said Devine, author of The Scottish Nation 1700 to 2007 and chair of history at Edinburgh university, the Scots are a more confident nation. The English, meanwhile, are less certain of their place in the world. Crises over Europe, unemployment, immigration and national identity, and misconceptions about Scotland's levels of subsidy, have led to rises in English nationalism.; There are strong signs of that in the surge in support for the UK Independence party, Devine argues:; Professor Rob Colls, professor of cultural history at the International Centre for Sports History and Culture at De Montfort university in Leicester, believes the result could influence voting in the independence referendum:; Colls is organising an academic conference on the social and political significance of the England versus Scotland game in October; he suspects Alex Salmond, Scotland's nationalist first minister, and David Cameron, the UK's Tory prime minister, will be watching the result with interest.; This contest matters more to the Scots than England fans, who see Germany as their greatest rivals. And during the last world cup in South Africa a large minority of Scotland fans bought t-shirts emblazoned with the slogan "anyone but England"; national flags for England's opponents did a roaring trade.; He also thinks the Scotland team will feel a greater desire to win, because of the greater cultural and sporting significance of the contest in Scotland. Despite vigorously waving a large St Andrew's cross at Wimbledon when Andy Murray won the men's singles, Salmond will not be at Wembley but Colls does not think that matters:; The view that this rivalry has great political significance is controversial. Many commentators believe that for most Scots, it is a British sporting rivalry equivalent to a Londoner who supports Arsenal hating Tottenham, or a Liverpool fan loathing near neighbours Everton. One poll in 2010 suggested an equal number of Scots would support England in South Africa, while a large minority were not interested.; Hamish Husband, a Tartan Army spokesman, and Pete Wishart, the Scottish National party MP and its sport spokesman at Westminster, both question Colls and Devine's analysis.; Husband thinks next summer Commonwealth games in Glasgow will be more significant politically, since England will face Scotland on the athletics track much nearer to the September 2014 independence referendum:; Scotland fans now are more anxious about failing to qualify for the world cup.; Wishart disputes claims that the London Olympics strengthened British pride or damaged his party's quest for independence in Scotland, but he does suspect a majority of Tartan Army members would support independence. It would be an interesting issue to test, he thinks.; Garford Beck, manager of the supporters group Englandfans FC, who saw the Scottish pitch invasion in 1977 and is arranging a friendly match for the fans before the Wembley game, also thinks that Scotland could win.; Beck predicts that the atmosphere at Wembley will be far more subdued than in the 1970s; there are signs some tickets will remain unsold and only 20,000 Scotland fans will be in the ground. But he suspects that obnoxious songs about Scotland and independence will still resound from the English stands.; While many English fans are too young to remember the 1970s, goading opponents is part of the sport. Beck, who works as a professional scout, said:; Expecting too that the Scots may repay that in kind from the terraces, he admits to anxieties about next year's independence referendum:
