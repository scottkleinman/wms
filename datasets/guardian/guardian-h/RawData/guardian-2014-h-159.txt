There are more on the YouTube clips of students attending rallies against the redundancies in June and again last Tuesday (6 July). The college seems to inspire a passion beyond the usual measures of student satisfaction.; "For me it has been amazing," says Esme Duggleby, a former nanny who, after leaving school with four GCSEs 10 years ago, has just completed an access to humanities and social studies course at the college and is going to Goldsmiths to study for a BA in education, culture and society. She says City Lit diagnosed her dyslexia on her first day and after that, with "phenomenal teaching and support", she achieved more than she ever thought possible. "They taught me how I learn," she says.; But the course she attended will no longer be available. The college, which was founded in 1919 to provide affordable education to the people of London and is now the largest adult education centre in Europe, issued redundancy notices last month for 73 posts, affecting 66 employees. Worst hit was the Fresh Horizons university access and English and maths GCSE programme. The entire programme orginally faced closure but has been rescued in part following a consultation, and most GCSEs and all evening classes will now continue. The principal, Mark Malcomson, says it was felt particularly important to continue these classes because there was little alternative evening provision in London.; But the access programme will be severely diminished, and the course Duggleby followed is not taking enrolments. Jobs are also going from learning support and the counselling service, which, protesters argue, will affect the most vulnerable learners.; Also badly affected is deaf education, a flagship area of expertise for City Lit, which is the biggest centre for deaf education in Europe. While Malcomson insists that courses for deaf learners will be untouched, courses for professionals supporting deaf people, including notetakers, will go.; A senior source at City Lit blames the government for cutting support for deaf students, which has forced the college to find savings to top up the shortfall. "The government doesn't recognise the need to fund adult education, but cutting this funding is going to directly affect the number of people out of work so it's very shortsighted of them," says the source, adding that even though courses for deaf adults will continue, the quality of provision is likely to be affected because of cutting staff in co-ordinator roles. "We got outstanding in our last inspection. How are we going to maintain that outstanding education with fewer staff?"; Protesters are angry that the redundancies follow an expensive marketing campaign by the college and an increase in the number of short courses it offers. Duggleby, who is particularly incensed by the continuing availability of graffiti crosstitch when access courses are closing, describes them as "short hobby courses for middle-class retirees".; But Malcomson, who was appointed last year from the London Business School, says expanding these kinds of courses is an essential part of securing the college's future. Managers at the college say government funding cuts, combined with extra pension and national insurance costs, will amount to £1.7m a year less for the college by 2015.; "As funding is reduced and costs go up we are doing everything we can to ensure our social and community provision continues," says Malcomson. "One way to do that is to run more classes popular with the people who pay full price, and that money is then reallocated."; Access provision is particularly expensive because it is so labour intensive, he says. The college has also had problems recruiting students to some access courses because the kinds of students these courses serve are reluctant to take on high tuition fee loans.; He says part of the reason the college has been spending on marketing is to attract more fee-paying students to help subsidise "more charitable provision" over the long term. Fees at the college are increasing by 7% on average. "Our prime ethos is to encourage adult education at all levels in London," he says.; Staff say they support the diversity of the college, which now has 30,000 adult learners and has attracted high-profile names including authors Malorie Blackman and Andrea Levy on to its short courses. But some are concerned that the balance is shifting away from the people who most need the education it provides.; The University and College Union has passed a vote of no confidence in the principal and organised a letter-writing campaign among former students asking the governing body to rethink the redundancies. A UCU spokesman argues that government cuts have been on the cards for a long time and managers should have anticipated them better. "We have to spend what money we have wisely and pay attention to what our core business is. We feel the priorities are wrong and that an awful lot of money is being spent on short courses in beer-tasting and burlesque whereas the core programme is being reduced. City Lit is in danger of becoming more like a leisure facility than a serious institution if we carry on like this."; Among former students "devastated" by that prospect is Lewis Pogson, who has just completed his second year at Brighton University after studying on a Fresh Horizons access to humanities and social sciences course in 2012. He said he was "gutted" that his course was closing.; He left school at 14 with no formal qualifications and a feeling that "there was a gulf between me and education". After spending time in prison, he felt on his release that he had little prospect of finding employment. "From my personal circumstances there was little on offer for me," he says. "I had few options to do something productive with my life and this programme supported me and let me excel." He is now considering postgraduate study.
