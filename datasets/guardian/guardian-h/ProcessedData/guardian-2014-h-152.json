EurasiaNet reports\tHear a man speaking Tajik on Moscow\u2019s fashionable Krymskaya Embankment, and you could be forgiven for thinking he's migrant worker on break from one of the many construction sites in the area. But listen carefully and you realise that it\u2019s a native Russian-speaker practicing a new language.; This summer, the nearby state-funded Muzeon Park is offering free Central Asian language classes. Organisers say they founded the School of Migrants\u2019 Languages to build cultural bridges between the millions of migrant labourers in Russia, mostly from Central Asia, and their hosts, who can often be hostile toward guest workers.; The school offers three Central Asian languages \u2013 Tajik, Uzbek and Kazakh, as well as Moldovan, which is very similar to Romanian. Native speakers from various university linguistics departments around Moscow teach the languages \u2013 one class each per week \u2013 in a special pavilion in the park.; Teachers upload scanned teaching materials and textbooks, which students can download to view on tablets or print before class (the Tajik materials are available here).; \u201cIt\u2019s a goal for us that people can learn about other nationalities and become familiar with their culture, learn the essentials, visit their countries and speak their native languages. This is to create understanding between nations, not just linguistic but human,\u201d Veronica Sergeeva, director of the School of Migrants\u2019 Languages, told EurasiaNet.org.; Sergeeva now believes the school should have offered Kyrgyz instead of Kazakh \u2013 there are far more Kyrgyz workers in Moscow than Kazakhs \u2013 but during an informal poll before classes started, the organisers found more interest in Kazakh.; On a recent warm and sunny Friday evening, the pavilion was packed for a Tajik language class; there was not one free chair. Tajik is the most popular course, Sergeeva said, with 45 to 55 people attending every week. Though Muzeon closed registration at the beginning of May, people continue calling and asking to be let in. Sergeeva doesn\u2019t mind; she can\u2019t just throw them out, she said. She suspects Russians have such an interest in Tajik because it is \u201cthe most exotic language\u201d on offer, and the Tajik population in Moscow is so visible.; Student Antonina Chelombeeva, a Russian-language teacher from Moscow, has a professional interest in Tajik (a close relative of Persian): some of her students are from Tajikistan.; \u201cIt\u2019s Omar Khayyam\u2019s language and I love his poetry. And I just like studying; I want to learn something new. Moreover, this is not just a linguistics course, the teacher describes a lot about Tajik culture,\u201d Chelombeeva told EurasiaNet.org.; \u201cTajik culture is fascinating,\u201d said Katya, 25, who attends the Tajik course with her friend, also named Katya. \u201cWe know nearly nothing about our neighbours\u2019 cultures. We [Russians] are prejudiced toward Tajiks, but this is an ancient nation with a great history and legacy.\u201d; Twenty-something Muscovite Alexey Laposhin hopes to learn some basic phrases so he can talk to Tajik workers in Moscow \u201cso they might feel more welcome.\u201d; Shortly after 7:30 pm, 64-year-old Navruz Gulzoda entered the classroom and bellowed out a string of warm Tajik salutations, as if he were bumping into an old friend on the streets of Dushanbe: \u201cAssalomy aleikum! Shumo chekhel? Naghzi khubi?\u201d Gulzoda asked, arms outstretched, bushy eyebrows perched high up on his forehead. (Hello! How are you? Are you well?).; \u201cKhubam,\u201d some students replied. (I am good).; Gulzoda taught at the Tajik National University for almost 40 years until 2012, when he took a position at the Moscow State Linguistic University. He is glad that Tajik is the most popular language at Muzeon, but a class of 50 is hard to manage, he confided. \u201cIt\u2019s actually impossible to learn in such conditions. We have just one lesson per week. However, those who really want to learn can gain some knowledge. I am trying to give them something,\u201d Gulzoda told EurasiaNet.org.; Uzbek is less popular. Offered on Tuesdays evenings, it attracts only 10 to 15 people. One is Maxim, 24, who is writing his PhD on Uzbek-Russian and Uzbek-American relations at the Russian State University for the Humanities. He understands he won\u2019t develop an advanced knowledge during the three-month course, but he hopes to be able to read Uzbek with a dictionary.; The teacher\u2019s favourite is Marian Borisovich, a 73-year-old pensioner who is attending all four language courses and never misses a class. Asked why, he simply said: \u201cIt\u2019s never too late to study.\u201d Out of the four, Uzbek, with its rounded vowels, is his favourite, he said.; The courses end in late July, when Muzeon will offer certificates to those who pass a final exam.; Sergeeva, the school\u2019s director, said she\u2019s been encouraged by the popularity of the summer language courses and plans to offer even more next summer. \u201cLots of people want to learn languages from the former Soviet republics: Armenian, Georgian, Ukrainian, Baltic languages. We were surprised by the number of people,\u201d she said.",
