The recent finding that the resource accounting and budgeting (RAB) charge \u2013 or the proportion of unpaid student loan debt that is covered by the taxpayer \u2013 may reach 45% shocked many.; An Institute for Fiscal Studies report put the figure at 43.3%. This means that for every \u00a31 lent to students, 45p is not recovered. By contrast, the Australian equivalent \u2013 25% for standard tuition fee loans \u2013 is a much healthier figure.; On the surface, this would seem reason enough to adopt the features of the Australian tuition fee system. But this could result in unintended consequences.; A central reason the Australian loan system is so much cheaper to the taxpayer is that tuition fees in Australia are significantly lower than they are in the UK. Fees are a maximum of \u00a35,500 per year (and often much less) in Australia, compared with up to \u00a39,000 per year in the UK.; The high debt levels in the UK hugely reduce graduates' chances of fully repaying their loans. With lower debt levels, it is hardly surprising that the Australian government finds it easier to recoup their fee money.; The Australians further reduce their RAB charge by varying fees according to subject. Fees are lower for subjects that typically render lower returns (humanities and education students pay the lowest fees and tend to be low-earning graduates) whereas those subjects that turn out the highest-earning graduates (economics) and high-cost (medicine) have the highest fee caps.; By linking likeliness to repay to tuition fee levels, the Australian system minimises the probability of non-repayment of the loan.; But it is not clear why the UK would want to emulate such a system. Charging fee levels according to how much one might earn in the future, rather than according to the cost of actually providing the degree, could exacerbate socioeconomic inequalities if debt-averse students (usually from poorer backgrounds) choose to study low-priced subjects that will go on to deliver lower wages.; There have been murmurings of a similar system in the UK, but with fees linked to the institution attended rather than the subject studied. Such a system would suffer from the same kinds of problems, with debt-averse students potentially staying away from high-fee elite institutions.; Furthermore, while the Australian system has a lower taxpayer loss in the form of unpaid tuition fees, the taxpayer contribution in the form of teaching money is considerably higher in Australia. For example, for a humanities student, the Australian government contributes around \u00a33,000 per year (versus zero contribution in the UK) \u2013 making the total government spend on fees for humanities students roughly the same in each country, assuming a UK RAB of 43% of \u00a38,500.; If the UK government really wanted to minimise the RAB charge, it could do so by lowering fees. If it wanted to reduce the RAB to zero \u2013 as is the case for some Australian loans \u2013 it could similarly do so by going back to the pre-1998 system of having no fees at all.; Another feature of the Australian system that the Hepi report highlights is the removal of caps on student numbers. The UK currently enforces a system of fee caps to control the high cost of the university system, though the controls are set to be removed in 2015. Here, we can learn from Australia's experience, given their removal of number caps in 2008.; There are many positives coming out of the Australian experience. Universities have been able to meet the massive over-demand for places, with student numbers increasing by around 20% on average, and a slight rise in the share of places for low socioeconomic status students.; But the Australian experience also highlights some downsides. The surge in student numbers has led to larger class sizes and, as popular courses balloon, there are reports of the graduate labour market becoming flooded in fields with limited job prospects. More worryingly, the policy was not accompanied by any kind of regulation on entry or exit standards, and has led to an inevitable decline in standards.; Universities have been quick to relax entry requirements, and some have removed requirements for certain subjects \u2013 for example, it is now possible for some students to read engineering without having studied mathematics up to the age of 18.; It would be deeply concerning if the UK were to make the same mistake here and let our reputation as a world leader in higher education decline. The Australian government now recognises this, and is considering applying a minimum entry standard that must be met before a place will be funded. The UK would do well to consider a similar type of regulation in time for 2015. Now that really would be learning.; Gill Wyness is a researcher at the London School of Economics and lecturer in economics at the Institute of Education.; Richard Murphy is a researcher at the London School of Economics and UCL.
