The Muslim minority were overwhelmingly the victims of pillage, murder and terror, resulting in the deaths of more than 2,000 men, women and children. Women, in particular, were subjected to brutal acts of violence and were left largely unprotected by the security forces. Although some members of Narendra Modi's government are now facing trial, Modi himself repeatedly refuses to accept any responsibility or to render an apology. Such a failure of moral character and political ethics on the part of Modi is incompatible with India's secular constitution, which, in advance of many constitutions across the world, is founded on pluralist principles and seeks fair and full representation for minorities. Were he to be elected prime minister, it would bode ill for India's future as a country that cherishes the ideals of inclusion and protection for all its peoples and communities.; Anish Kapoor, artist Homi K Bhabha, professor of the humanities, Harvard University Salman Rushdie, novelist Deepa Mehta, film director Dayanita Singh, artist Vivan Sundaram, artist Dame Helena Kennedy, barrister Imran Khan, solicitor Mike Wood, British Member of Parliament John McDonnell, British Member of Parliament Fiona Mactaggart, British Member of Parliament Jacqueline Bhabha, director of research, Fran√ßois-Xavier Bagnoud Center for Health and Human Rights, Harvard University Kumar Shahani, film director Geeta Kapur, art historian Pragna Patel, director of the Southall Black Sisters Sashi Kumar, film producer Jayati Ghosh, economist Prabhat Patnaik, economist MK Raina, actor/film director Ram Rahman, artist Saeed Mirza, screenwriter Anuradha Kapur, National School of Drama in Delhi Kumkum Sangari, professor of English and the humanities, University of Wisconsin Gautam Appa, emeritus professor, London School of Economics Chetan Bhatt, professor of sociology, London School of Economics Suresh Grover, director, Southall Monitoring Group
