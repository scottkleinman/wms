He had previously served a prison term in America for child molestation and went on to abuse children at international schools around the world before computer hardware containing hundreds of images of children on school trips was discovered by a maid when he was workingat a school in Nicaragua in March. He fled to the US where he killed himself.; The interim findings of the review, commissioned by Southbank, was circulated to parents on Thursday. They reveal that concerns about the humanities teacher's "unusual/ questionable conduct" were known about and that "inadequate" record keeping meant the alarm was not raised.; "Had what was reported within the school about Vahey's conduct at the school been appropriately recorded and evaluated, the pattern of conduct recorded would have required direct intervention by the school," Davies said. "As a minimum [this would have meant] reviewing his role on school trips and almost certainly further independent investigation under the direction and control of the local authority designated officer."; Concerns about Vahey were not referred to local authority child protection experts for advice, as they should have been, and there was "a collective lack of understanding about what to report", Davies concluded.; A school source said fears were raised about Vahey's conduct on school trips in his first year. "Complaints were made about him wanting to spend time alone with boys," the source said. "He would say he would stay behind with the boys and the lead teacher would say that was against guidelines. [The teachers] made complaints to the management."; Davies found that Southbank school's child protection officers had an inadequate understanding of statutory guidance. He said there was an "under-reporting of concerns relating to Vahey" and school staff needed better education about questionable conduct and when to report it. Child protection policies were not "fully understood and/or implemented" and there was a lack of training among the school's child protection officers.; The conclusions follow interviews with 13 school officials including the executive principal, Graham Lacey, and the chairman of the school board, Sir Chris Woodhead, the former chief inspector of schools. Former headteacher Hedger is yet to be interviewed.; Woodhead said on Thursday that better recording of complaints should have been in place, but he did not accept it would have led to Vahey being stopped from abusing boys. "The recording of events should have been better," he said. "There would have been some intervention but what that would have been is speculation.; "Many of Mr Davies recommendations are already in place. By the beginning of next term, Southbank's safeguarding procedures will be absolutely compliant in every way."; Vahey's crimes emerged in April sparking an international criminal investigation involving the FBI and Scotland Yard. One schoolboy who went on a field trip with Vahey's "travel club", told the Guardian that Vahey escorted him alone to his bedroom because he felt dizzy and drowsy after a meal which he now fears was spiked with sleeping pills. The boy said Vahey's behaviour was so "creepy" that he was known among some schoolboys as "Vahey – the paedo".; The recruitment process used to hire Vahey failed to meet statutory guidelines, said Davies. The job was not advertised, Davies says no references were taken on Vahey before his interview and they were only requested after he was interviewed alone by Hedger and had been conditionally offered a job.; In an FBI affadavit given before he killed himself in March, Vahey claimed he "never hurt any of the boys" as "they did not know what had happened to them; they were completely asleep".; Scotland Yard child abuse detectives have told parents they have established the identity of about 60 boys from the school in Vahey's photos by cross-checking images found on his hardware with pictures in the school's year books. Because Vahey drugged his victims and his crimes did not involve leaving physical marks or sensations, parents and boys have been left with a decision about whether to find out if Vahey had victimised them.; Davies's review states the school is "on notice that appropriate trauma counselling may be required for affected students and staff, most particularly next term and beyond, for any delayed reaction".; Control Risks, a consultancy "specialising in political, integrity and security risk" is carrying out checks on the history of each teacher employed at the school.
