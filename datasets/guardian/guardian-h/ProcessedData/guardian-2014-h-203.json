One can\u2019t change it. And people need to understand that the government has changed in Canberra, that we\u2019re not simply administering the previous government\u2019s policies or views, and I know that the left will find that rather galling, and while we govern for everyone, there is a new management in town.\u201d; Enter stage right, Kevin Donnelly, a conservative education commentator who, in a piece titled \u2018Cultural-left rules education\u2019 on 9 November 2013, wrote: \u201cThe history curriculum, in addition to uncritically promoting diversity and difference instead of what binds as a community and a nation, undervalues western civilisation and the significance of Judeo-Christian values to our institutions and way of life.\u201d; Donnelly has expressed the same view numerous times in the past, fitting neatly with the concerns of Pyne.; When he appointed Donnelly and the public administration professor Ken Wiltshire to lead the Coalition\u2019s promised curriculum review in January 2014, the education minister observed: \u201cSo, yes, the truth of the way we\u2019ve treated Indigenous Australians should be told in our curriculum, but also the truth about the benefits of western civilisation should be taught in our curriculum. And I think that there is some fair criticism that the curriculum is balanced one way rather than the other.\u201d; Lo and behold, the review released on Sunday found: \u201cThe Australian curriculum: history should be revised in order to properly recognise the impact and significance of western civilisation and Australia\u2019s Judeo-Christian heritage, values and beliefs \u2026 The curriculum needs to better acknowledge the strengths and weaknesses and the positives and negatives of both western and Indigenous cultures and histories.\u201d; This confluence of opinions, before and after the review, does not automatically mean the findings as they relate to western civilisation are wrong.; But the Donnelly/Wiltshire report contains precious little by way of specific evidence that this area is ignored or downgraded. Instead, the document relies on excerpts of critical public submissions simply arguing that is so.; In a section of the report titled \u201cwestern civilisation\u201d, the authors quote the Institute of Public Affairs \u2013 a thinktank that has close links to the Liberal party \u2013 as saying the curriculum is \u201cunbalanced, ideologically biased and systematically hostile to the legacy of western civilisation\u201d.; The same section summarises the Presbyterian Church of Victoria\u2019s church and nation committee\u2019s view that history students \u201care preconditioned towards a negative view of western society\u201d.; \u201cFor example, the negative, rather than the positive, outcomes of western society are discussed, topics such as: slavery, oppression, promotion of disadvantage, war (conscription), colonisation, imperialism, dominance of the church,\u201d the selected extract says.; Balance on such topics is in the eye of the beholder.; In a convoluted example of wrangling divergent opinions, the report said: \u201cNotwithstanding that some submissions argue there is no bias in the Australian curriculum: history document, others suggest there is a lack of balance as the curriculum, especially as a result of the cross-curriculum priorities, fails to adequately deal with the historical impact and significance of western civilisation and Australia\u2019s Judeo-Christian heritage and values and beliefs.\u201d; What are the facts?; Primary school history gradually increases in complexity, but includes the study of Indigenous Australians, European exploration and colonisation and 19th century colonial Australia.; In year 6 history, students learn about \u201ckey figures and events that led to Australia\u2019s federation, including British and American influences on Australia\u2019s system of law and government\u201d.; The curriculum documents say this topic includes \u201cidentifying key elements of Australia\u2019s system of law and government and their origins (for example the Magna Carta; federalism; constitutional monarchy; the Westminster system and the separation of powers \u2013 legislature, executive, judiciary; the houses of parliament; how laws are made)\u201c.; Year 7 students studying the ancient world look at \u201cthe major religions/philosophies that emerged by the end of the period (Hinduism, Judaism, Buddhism, Confucianism, Christianity, Islam), and their key beliefs (through group work)\u201c.; In year 8 history students are given an \u201coverview of the ancient to modern world\u201d.; This content includes: the transformation of the Roman world and the spread of Christianity and Islam; key features of the medieval world (feudalism, trade routes, voyages of discovery, contact and conflict); and the emergence of ideas about the world and the place of people in it by the end of the period (such as the Renaissance, the Scientific Revolution and the Enlightenment).; Students then conduct three in-depth studies, one on the western and Islamic world, one on the Asia-Pacific world, and one on \u201cexpanding contacts\u201d such as the Spanish conquest of the Americas.; Year 9 history students study \u201cthe making of the modern world\u201d, which includes industrialisation and rapid change in the ways people lived, worked and thought. It canvasses nationalism, imperialism, and the colonisation of Australia.; Students then choose from a range of possible depth studies, such as progressive ideas and movements, the Industrial Revolution, movement of peoples, the first world war, and the making of the Australian nation including development of self-government and democracy.; The year 10 history curriculum focuses on the history of the modern world and Australia from 1918 to the present \u201cwith an emphasis on Australia in its global context\u201d.; Is this history curriculum unbalanced? Readers can make up their own minds by exploring the Australian curriculum website here. A lot of the angst from conservative commentators springs from the fact that the three \u201ccross-curriculum priorities\u201d relate to Indigenous affairs, Australia\u2019s place in Asia and sustainability.; One of two experts commissioned by Donnelly and Wiltshire to specifically examine the history curriculum, Professor Gregory Melleuish, suggested it lacked coherence, contained too much optional depth study and not enough core content, and was rigid and overly prescriptive. In supplementary material released at the same time as the review, Melleuish suggested specific changes.; But the second commissioned history reviewer, Clive Logan, was generally positive. He found the curriculum balanced \u201cknowledge and understanding, key concepts and skills that provide a sound disciplinary framework\u201d and had \u201ca well-thought out progression, logical in structure, scope and sequence with a determined view to give a breadth of local, Australian and world history as possible\u201d.; The History Teachers\u2019 Association of Australia told the review the existing depth studies provided students \u201cwith the opportunity to understand the emergence of western civilisation and democratic principles as well as Australia\u2019s rich history\u201d, warning the addition of more mandatory units could exacerbate overcrowding concerns.; There are some sensible recommendations in the overall review, including those addressing the widely expressed view of teachers that the primary school curriculum in particular is too crowded \u2013 in short, too much breadth, not enough depth.; These sorts of changes are the ones most likely to gain the broad political, parental and public support. There are other recommendations aimed at improving the focus on literacy and numeracy in the early years, increasing the number of geography field trips, and ensuring the curriculum is more user-friendly.; Pyne likes to say that everyone is an expert on education because they went to school, but for his latest assignment on western civilisation he needs to present more supporting evidence.",
