You'd better believe it	The Times Higher Education survey results are no surprise: Sheffield is inclusive, welcoming and joyfully cheap	The response I receive from many uninformed people when I reveal that I went to university in Sheffield ranges from surprise and polite mumbling about steel to a not remotely concealed it's-grim-up-north face, along with a confused "why?"; Well, those who have been a student in Sheffield, or indeed have visited the city for a significant amount of time, will know the answer. Rated number one in this year's Times Higher Education Student Experience survey, the University of Sheffield is quite rightly being recognised for being a fantastic place to study in a poll that isn't exclusively focused on academia.; Aside from writing essays and making PowerPoint presentations at 3am, being a student is also about learning to live independently, getting along with people you would never normally choose to live with and managing a workload without anybody breathing down your neck to do it. These are all a significant part of the student experience and living in Sheffield makes them a great deal easier.; Sheffield is a strikingly friendly city: you don't feel like a little fish in an inconceivably big pond, like so many of my friends who went to university in London did, and that is perhaps a contributing factor towards the underperformance of London universities in this survey. It is a joyfully cheap place to live: rent is cheap, beer is cheap, transport is cheap, which makes the transition from home to student digs that little bit easier – your student loan goes that bit further.; As well as the city, the university itself is inclusive and welcoming with the student's union being one of the best in the country, consistently putting equality policies at the forefront of its agenda, for example being one of the first to introduce gender-neutral toilets – a small but significant step for an all-too-often overlooked and under-represented portion of the student population. The union also hosts the city's most popular gay night.; Student experience not being exclusively about academia obviously plays an important part, especially now undergraduates are paying up to £9,000 a year. My academic experience at the University of Sheffield was excellent, which is one of the reasons I chose to stay on and complete my MA there. I can only speak for the history department, but despite suffering cuts like everywhere else, the tutors were dedicated, available, and are leaders in their field. For the BA, teaching time averaged at six hours a week, as with every other humanities course, but there were study groups and other academic opportunities for those who wanted to take advantage of them.; I cannot speak for the students of universities such as the London School of Economics, which scored comparatively low on student experience, despite having a great deal of academic prestige. But perhaps it is a lack of a community feel which adds to this: the feeling of living in an anonymous city and not really belonging to something, as well as other more tangible reasons such as expensive housing and living costs.; It's this sense of belonging and close-knit community, as well as the academic experience, which gives Sheffield its edge when it comes to excelling in student experience and why, two years after graduating, I'm still here.
