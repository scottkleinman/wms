2/4/2014	OBITUARIES;PASSINGS / Joan Mondale;Vice president's wife, arts backer	Joan Mondale, 83, who built a reputation as a national cultural arts advocate while her husband was vice president, died Monday, her family said in a statement released by their Minneapolis church. She had been in hospice care, but no cause was disclosed.;So passionate about the arts that she was nicknamed "Joan of Art," Mondale was an avid potter when her husband, Walter, then a Democratic U.S. senator from Minnesota, was elected Jimmy Carter's vice president in 1976.;Carter named Joan Mondale honorary chairwoman of the Federal Council on the Arts and Humanities. She traveled frequently to museums, theaters and artists' studios on the administration's behalf, and she lobbied Congress and states for more spending on public arts programs.;She would later take her cultural zeal overseas when her husband was named U.S. ambassador to Japan during President Clinton's administration. She relished the chance to study Japanese art and give dignitaries clay pots she made as gifts.;She was born Joan Adams in Eugene, Ore., on Aug. 8, 1930. Along with her two sisters, she moved several times during childhood as their father, a Presbyterian minister, took new assignments. The family finally settled in St. Paul, Minn., where Joan earned an undergraduate degree at Macalester College.;It was the same liberal arts school that Walter Mondale attended, but they were a few years apart and didn't meet until 1955, when one of Joan's sisters arranged a blind date. Six months later they were engaged, and they married soon after.;--;news.obits@latimes.com;Credit: Times Staff and Wire Reports;Illustration;Caption: PHOTO: 'JOAN OF ART' Vice President Walter Mondale with his wife Joan, honorary chair of the Federal Council on the Arts and Humanities., PHOTOGRAPHER:Associated Press
