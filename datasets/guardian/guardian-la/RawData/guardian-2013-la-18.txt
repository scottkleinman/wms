Saturday 27 April 2013 19.05 EDT	Mark Kermode's DVD round-up	Life of Pi; Bait; The Oranges	Even as Ang Lee's Life of Pi (2012, Fox, PG) picked up Oscars for direction, cinematography, music and, crucially, visual effects, there was disgruntlement among the VFX effects team that their work on the movie had not been sufficiently recognised. Certainly, the digital wizardry is extraordinary, making the audience believe that they have been cast adrift on an endless ocean with a man-eating tiger, putting us right there in the lifeboat with the story's titular hero. All the more tragic, then, that Rhythm & Hues, which provided so much of the film's computer graphic magic, had filed for bankruptcy just before the Oscars, the latest victim of a downward spiral that had seen VFX artists become the most important but least valued craftspeople in Hollywood.; The irony, of course, is that visual effects are often at their best when unnoticed, and the real triumph of Life of Pi is that it doesn't play as some SFX extravaganza. On the contrary, it is an utterly engrossing fable – a meditation upon the nature of storytelling itself which brilliantly captures the heart and soul of Yann Martel's source novel.; Screen newcomer Suraj Sharma is astonishing in his very first starring role as the teenager who survives a shipwreck, only to find himself trapped in a lifeboat with a carnivorous beast who must be feared and respected, tamed and cared for, distanced and embraced. That the tiger, named "Richard Parker" due to an absurdist clerical error, should become as real a presence as any of the film's human cast is extraordinary in itself, but what raises it to the level of the sublime is what the tiger comes to represent – the power of nature, the instinct for survival, the struggle for life itself.; Like the lion from The Chronicles of Narnia, this is a beast imbued with profound spiritual significance, although the role of religion is here defined more as a narrative than a transcendent truth. As the adult Pi Patel (Irrfan Khan) asks Rafe Spall's incredulous writer: "Which story do you prefer?"; It says much about the artistry of Life of Pi that such questions are served by (rather than subject to) the breathtaking visuals, which are duly investigated and celebrated in the DVD extras. In cinemas this converted some to the stereoscopic cause, joining the ranks of Dial M for Murder, Flesh for Frankenstein and Hugo as one of those rare exceptions that validate the format. On hi-def Blu-ray the film is presented in both 2D and 3D versions, of which the former lacks nothing in terms of emotional power and immersive experience.; One could argue that stereoscopic shark-jumping antics are the only reason to watch Bait (2012, StudioCanal, 15), a moderately budgeted, knowingly trashy romp that goes one better than Jaws 3-D by setting its man-eaters loose in a supermarket, thanks to a seafront-flooding tsunami. Thus, rather than a boring beach, we get people scuttling on to shelves and out of sunroofs to escape sharks in the car park and snappers amid the shopping trolleys.; With six credited writers (including Highlander director Russell Mulcahy, who cut his own teeth on the killer pig movie Razorback), it's no surprise that this rattles around like a bag of assorted bones stripped clean from the body parts of other movies. Yet as latter-day Corman cash-ins go, this is infinitely preferable to either the loathsome Piranha 3DD or the unwatchable Mega Shark vs Giant Octopus, neither of which raised even a flicker of interest.; While Bait's predators may look more digital than dangerous, there's comic relief to be had from a couple of airheaded Oz beach bums who seem to have wandered off the set of Alvin Purple merrily bickering about their shoes and mobile phones even as killer fish try to swallow them. Rubbish, then, but proud of it, and picked from the top of the heap rather than scraped from the bottom of the barrel.; With his matchless credentials as a bona fide American TV star and a burgeoning second career as a respected blues pianist and singer, Hugh Laurie needn't worry that his feature film career is somewhat less than stellar. In British director Julian Farino's The Oranges (2011, Paramount, 15), he plays a likable, middle-aged suburban drudge who outrages his neighbours by taking up with a girl young enough to be his daughter, with whose father (Oliver Platt) he was formerly best friends.; Despite a dynamite cast including Allison Janney and Catherine Keener, this never rises above the level of the spring/September cliches that it seems to want to deconstruct. It doesn't help that Laurie and Leighton Meester never look for one moment as though they are having a relationship, the utter lack of chemistry removing both the purpose and point of the story (you end up wondering why anybody, no matter how unhappy, would leave somebody as charismatic as Catherine Keener, and concluding that they wouldn't).; Compare this with the broiling tensions evident in the underrated Liberal Arts, in which Josh Radnor and Elizabeth Olsen make an altogether more effective fist of dismantling a Hollywood dream and concluding that there really is such a thing as age appropriateness after all. As for The Oranges, despite outre lines about being "the only son in history to have been cock-blocked by his own dad", this is too bland to be toe-curlingly satirical, settling instead for being merely trite, and a little bit trying.
