The idea is that students learn new content outside the classroom (usually online) and then tackle assignments in lessons, giving teachers more time to help students with aspects they don't understand. Chris, who's been experimenting with the method for a few weeks, talks about how he's been using it to teach division.; Firstly, he emails students two videos on YouTube about the topic, asking them to watch the clips over the weekend and bring any questions to school on Monday. In the lesson, he sets challenges on short and long division. What's interesting is that instead of assigning students tasks based on their ability, students can choose the problems they'd like work on depending on the level they believe they're at.; Ten minutes into the class an Ofsted inspector walks in. Chris writes: \"Some of the pupils had chosen to stay with me to explore their misconceptions.; \"This is where the children really excelled. They knew which part of the calculation strategy they were challenged by and could tell me about it in detail, because they had watched the video before the session.; \"The approach enabled me to spend more time questioning childrens' understanding and moving learning on.\"; And, he writes, \"what better way to endorse the use of a flipped classroom than a direct quote from our Ofsted report: 'An innovative use of e-tablets when learning about mathematics enabled pupils to make outstanding progress.'\"; We'll be exploring the different ways you can use the flipped learning approach to teach students. We'll be sharing lesson ideas, looking at the benefits and challenges, discussing research behind the idea and talking about where you can find resources to support the technique.; Join us on Thursday 3 April from 5:30pm to 7:30pm to chat about flipped learning.
