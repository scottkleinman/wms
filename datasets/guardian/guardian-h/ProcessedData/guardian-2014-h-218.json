We then print the best of your comments alongside Jeremy\u2019s own insights. Here is the latest dilemma \u2013 what are your thoughts?; My 15-year-old daughter has to choose in the next month or so what A-levels to take. She has no real preference for the arts or sciences, as she is good at both. She has an A-level in Japanese, plus GCSEs in Japanese, Latin and statistics and is studying for nine more this year. She is bilingual, good at maths, and she likes both arts and science subjects. She has good communication and empathy skills.; There seems so little advice on how to make this difficult choice. Her teachers know she\u2019s really organised so aren\u2019t too concerned. She has started exploring some personality/careers tests online.; With only a month to go what can you and your readers recommend? I hated having to choose myself as I enjoyed both sciences and arts. I wish the exam system would be changed to allow this crucial decision to be made a few years later, as it is in other countries.; Do you need advice on a work issue? For Jeremy\u2019s and readers\u2019 help, send a brief email to dear.jeremy@theguardian.com. Please note that he is unable to answer questions of a legal nature or to reply personally.",
