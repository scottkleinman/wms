But as a science student who is often stuck in the lab, I am envious of the extra time for independent study.; According to Unistats, English students spend just 12% of their time with a member of staff in their first year, compared with 32% for a physics student in the same year.; Contact hours can be a great thing. But when you're expected to complete essays, formal reports or work through several problem sheets a week it can seem as though there are not enough hours in the day.; Arts students often have more freedom when it comes to organising their time. Sophie Bunting, an art history student at the University of Birmingham, says: "As I have only three hours contact time a week, I can completely organise my day, if I am busy in the evening I can work harder during the day and vice versa."; Science students that rely on part-time work to help with the cost of living have less flexibility when applying for work than arts students. A study conducted by David Robotham, University of De Montfort, found that humanities students were more likely to have a part-time job with 42% of all humanities students interviewed juggling employment with their studies.; If you're a science student with dependents that need to be cared for the number of contact hours that come with a science degree can be an extra challenge.; Of course, there are reasons why science students need to spend so much time in the classroom or lab. Ben Hanson, undergraduate department tutor for mechanical engineering at University College London, says: "Students work in classroom-sized groups on numerical or design questions and assignments – this form of teaching and learning is less suitable for, say, essay writing."; Ultimately, I'm very grateful for the amount of contact time I have as it is usually with an expert in my field of study. But when deadlines are looming and I'm stuck in the lab, I envy the freedom of independent study.; • What do you think – are contact hours always a good thing?
