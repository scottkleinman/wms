There will be letters he received from literary figures including Christopher Hitchens, David Lodge, Harold Pinter, Philip Roth, Salman Rushdie and \u2013 tantalisingly \u2013 his complete email correspondence from 1997. And there will be lots of material relating to his novels including Amsterdam, On Chesil Beach and Solar.; In an interview to mark the acquisition, McEwan said writers tended to forget the routes they discarded. \"Sometimes the path towards a finished novel takes surprising twists,\" he said. \"It's rarely an even development. For example, my novel Atonement started out as a science fiction story set two or three centuries into future.\"; There is always fierce competition to acquire literary archives, with the British Library heading the queue in the UK. The library, however, does not have the money that US institutions have, although the Harry Ransom Center stressed \"it will be paid with dedicated endowments and privately raised funds\".",
