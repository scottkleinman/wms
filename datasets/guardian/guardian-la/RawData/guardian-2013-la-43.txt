Tuesday 10 December 2013 06.22 EST	Jonzi D – review	Lilian Baylis Studio, London The hip-hop choreographer has turned his decision to reject an MBE into an entertainingly articulate stage show	Back in 2011 when Jonzi D was offered an MBE for services to British dance, the hip-hop choreographer was faced with a profound dilemma. Accept the award, and help to raise the profile of the street dance he'd done so much to develop. Or reject it, on the grounds that any legacy of empire and colonialism is irrevocably tainted. In the end he turned it down, and created The Letter to tell the story of how and why he did so.; Jonzi D has never been a virtuoso dancer, but he's a gregariously charismatic stage presence. He's also an excellent mimic. In this 45-minute solo of dance, monologue and mime, he conjures up an entertainingly articulate cast of family, friends and associates with whom he debates the matter of the award.; The voice of the liberal-arts establishment is neatly satirised, as Jonzi D impersonates the case for compromise, his white gloved hands (the only visible part of him) dancing their own suavely persuasive rhetoric. Also entering the debate are a comic gem of an East End matriarch, a black radical and his big sister, Ruth; through their vividly physical impersonation Jonzi D treads a fine and funny balance between personal and political dance theatre.; The Letter's companion piece, Broken Lineage, works less well. It's a confrontation between old and new school hip-hop, in which Jonzi D is cast as a guardian of the dance form's heroic, embattled past, and dancer Ivan Blackstock as a "degenerate" product of the internet age. The men's body language is fraught with the drama of generational conflict. Yet too much of their spoken material gets lots in the delivery, and the dance feels undeveloped.; • Did you catch this show – or any other recently? Tell us about it using #gdnreview
