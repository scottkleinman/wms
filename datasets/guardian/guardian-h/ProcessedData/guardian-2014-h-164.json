Richards is a trained doctor working in medical research.; Olsson almost didn\u2019t write Boy, Lost, she told Guardian Australia.; The story centres around Olsson\u2019s older brother, who was abducted from their mother\u2019s arms by her violent first husband. Olsson had no idea of Peter\u2019s existence for many years.; \u201cIt was always made plain to me that this was a story that was off limits. We couldn\u2019t ever ask questions about my mother\u2019s earlier life and certainly not about that [experience] once we did know about it,\u201d she told Guardian Australia.; \u201cI didn\u2019t think I could ever write it, as the writer in the family. She made it plain to me that it was not on. Even after her death I didn\u2019t \u2013 the secret was so strong.\u201d; However, when Peter obtained documents from government departments he \u201cclearly saw what his life had been\u201d and decided it might be interesting to look at it, said Olsson. He asked her to write the story.; Olsson said it\u2019s the hardest book she\u2019s written.; \u201cEven now I still feel like I\u2019m trespassing in some ways. But the story soon widened out for me. When I was about halfway through I started to see the resonances with stolen children all over Australia, right back to settlement.; \u201cI had two questions. Why did no one help Peter? In his father\u2019s care and step mother\u2019s care he was brutalised. He spent most of his young life on the street and contracted polio when he was very young.; \u201cAnd then why did no one help my mother? There were chances for both of them to be helped and no one ever did. They were failed systemically as well as at a personal level by lots of people.\u201d; Peter\u2019s story is not a rare one. In one way or another lots of children were being removed from their families at that time. Olsson lists the stolen generation, victims of forced adoptions, and the forgotten Australians \u2013 children brought out from Britain and Malta.; \u201cThis was happening all over the world but Australia seemed to me to have a particular amnesia around any of these sorts of systemic failures.\u201d; Olsson said the recent royal commission into institutional responses to child sexual abuse made it clear why no one helped Peter or her mother.; \u201cWe had become a country used to shattering families for the slightest of reasons,\u201d she said.; \u201cSo the book became that larger thing for me. But at its heart is this one family story and its kind of cascading effects of that grief right through my generation and my children\u2019s generation.\u201d; Boy, Lost has also won or been shortlisted for numerous state and Australian awards, including the Stella Prize and the Australian Human Rights Commission Literature Award.; \u201cIt\u2019s had some lovely recognition this year,\u201d said Olsson.; \u201cEach time there\u2019s something like this it gets a few more readers and I get a few more emails saying \u2018wow this happened in my family and now I get it\u2019.\u201d; The awards were set up in honour of Nita B Kibble, the first female librarian of the State Library, by her niece Nita Dobbie. They honour female-written, \u201clife writing\u201d in fiction or non-fiction.; Debra Adelaide for her collection of short stories in Letter to George Clooney, and Melissa Lucashenko for her novel Mullumbimby were shortlisted alongside Olsson.; Richards took the Dobbie Award over Fiona McFarlane\u2019s Night Guest and Jill Stark\u2019s High Sobriety: My Year Without Booze.; Close to $500,000 in prize money, drawn from a trust established to manage the initial $400,000 pool, has been awarded to female writers in the last 21 years. Past winners include Helen Garner, Geraldine Brooks and Annah Faulkner.",
