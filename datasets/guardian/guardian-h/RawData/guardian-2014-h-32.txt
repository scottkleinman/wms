	Language Festival November 2013	The British Academy's language festival celebrated the rich diversity of languages and culture around the country	The UK's first national Language Festival celebrated the diverse cultural richness of the UK and raised the profile of language learning among learners of all ages.; When we joined forces with the Guardian our aim was to raise the profile of language learning in the UK and celebrate the many benefits of foreign language skills for individuals and society.; Therefore, in November 2013 we launched a national Language Festival to provide a platform for schools, higher education institutions, students, policy makers and businesses from across the UK to discuss, debate and explore the academic, cultural and economic benefits of language learning. The festival built on the success of the British Academy's Language Week, held in November 2012, and will become an annual event with plans already developing for 2014.; In addition to dedicated events and activities which took place throughout November, the Language Festival website provided useful resources - such as a series of downloadable packs for primary and secondary schools, and businesses – to help individuals and institutions organise their own events to celebrate languages.; Language plays such an important part in so many aspects of our day-to-day lives that the range and breadth of topics to discuss are vast. Therefore, the website also included a forum for "live chats" where members of the public were able to ask expert panellists questions about specific topics. The first two "live chats" created lively discussions on: "Speaking softly: the cultural power of languages" a discussion on languages, social inclusion and cultural understanding; and "Languages for security and diplomacy".; At the British Academy, we hosted a number of language events throughout November, including: • a public art exhibition • audience and panel discussions • award ceremonies; The Voices of London exhibition was an exciting opportunity to showcase fifteen images of Londoners from a range of linguistic backgrounds. Run in conjunction with the Guardian Witness online interactive campaign (which asked readers to submit their pictures and stories of the languages they speak), the exhibition generated much interest and discussion and will soon be on display again at the Guardian's Kings Cross office.; Translation in a Digital Age The British Academy and the Arts & Humanities Research Council (AHRC) held a panel discussion to explore the recent developments in translation and assess the impact that technology will have on translation in the future.; Careers for Global Graduates The British Academy also partnered with ThirdYearAbroad.com and the European Commission to provide employers and graduates with an opportunity to discuss:; • the issues and benefits of spending a year abroad • how students can use this experience to improve their employment prospects • how employers can find the languages skills they need from British graduates. In order to provide employers with greater access to some of the brightest and most talented graduates from the UK, Lizzie Fane – the founder of ThirdYearAbroad.com, the UK's biggest online network supporting students who study, work or volunteer abroad during their degree – launched the new ThirdYearAbroad.com Careers Platform, a webpage where employers can post opportunities for global graduates. This was followed by a networking opportunity for students and employers.; The ceremony for the 2013 round of the British Academy Schools Language Awards, which recognise innovative and creative foreign language teaching in secondary schools across the UK, was held at the Academy. Teachers and students from the 13 winning schools attended the ceremony which was hosted by Larry Lamb. The Awards were also presented by Samir Singh and Steve Eadon from Arsenal FC Double Club, and television presenter Seema Pathan.; Wendy Berliner, Head of Editorial at the Guardian Labs, also announced the winner of the first ever Guardian Public Language Champion Award as Arsène Wenger.; "Being voted Britain's first ever Public Language Champion is an incredible honour. I am very proud that Arsenal and I can help raise the profile of language learning in schools. I hope that this award and Arsenal's Double Club can show that learning a new language does not always have to be a challenge and sport can help make learning enjoyable".
