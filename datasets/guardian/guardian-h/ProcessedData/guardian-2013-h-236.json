However new research, led by the University of Bristol, shows that they were evolutionary copy-cats who evolved tooth-like structures and tissues independently of other vertebrates. The origin of our skeleton is to be found in the armour of our ancestors who evolved bony armour to protect themselves from such predators. Philip Donoghue, co-author of the study at the University of Bristol, says: \"This removes a key piece of evidence from the hypothesis that teeth evolved before the skeletal armour, and suggests that the common ancestors of conodonts and other vertebrates likely lacked a mineralized skeleton. Rather, it seems that teeth evolved from the armour of our meek filter-feeding ancestors.\"; \u2022 Imperial College London A study has discovered profound abnormalities in brain activity in a group of retired American football players. Brain imaging tests revealed unusual activity that correlated with how many times they had left the field with a head injury during their careers. Previous research has found that former American football players experience higher rates of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. The new findings suggest that players also face a risk of subtle neurological deficits that don't show up on normal clinical tests. Adam Hampshire, lead author of the study, from Imperial College London, says: \"The critical fact is that the level of brain abnormality correlates strongly with the measure of head impacts of great enough severity to warrant being taken out of play. This means that it is highly likely that damage caused by blows to the head accumulate towards an executive impairment in later life.\" The findings also highlight the inadequacy of standard cognitive tests for detecting certain types of behavioural deficit. Hampshire adds: \"The results tell us something very interesting about the human brain, which is that after damage, it can work harder and bring extra areas on line in order to cope with cognitive tasks. It is likely that in more complicated real world scenarios, this plasticity is insufficient and consequently, the executive impairment is no longer masked. In this respect, the results are also of relevance to other patients who suffer from multiple head injuries.\"; \u2022 University of Cambridge Research shows that while a shift in personal music taste over a lifetime is intrinsically linked to personality and experience, there are common music genre trends associated with key stages in a human life. Findings show that the music we like adapts to the particular 'life challenges' we face at different stages of our lives. Using this theory, researchers say that we come to music to experiment with identity and define ourselves, and then use it as a social vehicle to establish our group and find a mate, and later as a more solitary expression of our intellect, status and greater emotional understanding. \"Teenage years are often dominated by the need to establish identity, and music is a cheap, effective way to do this,\" said Jason Rentfrow, senior researcher on the study at Cambridge. \"Adolescents' quest for independence often takes the shape of a juxtaposed stance to the perceived 'status quo', that of parents and the establishment. Once people overcome the need for autonomy, the next 'life challenge' concerns finding love and being loved.\" He adds: \"Whereas the first musical age is about asserting independence, the next appears to be more about gaining acceptance from others.\"; \u2022 Durham University High cost credit companies which charge huge rates of interest should be prevented from lending to people who cannot afford repayments, researchers urge. Sarah Banks, professor and co-director of Durham University's Centre for Social Justice and Community Action, says: \"Among the families we have been working with, high cost credit is commonplace and regarded as normal. There was low awareness of the huge interest rates and, instead, a simplistic focus on the weekly repayments rather than the total cost of this credit.\" She adds: \"We believe it is essential that high cost credit companies are made to adopt a charter to ensure that they cannot lend to people who are not able to afford these loans. We are recommending new regulations for data-sharing to ensure affordability, as well as a legal cap on the total cost of credit. Although supposedly for short-term use, in practice extremely high interest rates could last for months and Annual Percentage Rates of 4,000 per cent were common.\"; \u2022 University of Oxford Latest research shows more than half of those who go online do it without enthusiasm. Nearly one in six (14%) users felt the internet was taking over their lives and invading their privacy. An additional one-third (37%) of British users had no strong feelings either for or against the internet and were described as 'moderate' in their view. Some 17% said it made them more efficient; 12% said they were happy going online; and 19% had mixed views, feeling efficient and happier but also frustrated, according to the report. Grant Blank, a researcher from the Oxford Internet Institute, says: \"This survey shows that while most of us in Britain are now using the internet, half do it without enthusiasm. These are people who use the internet because they have to, not because they want to. They don't go online to enjoy themselves and they don't feel more productive online. They also perceive problems, particularly with regard to privacy, frustration and wasted time.\" He adds: \"The apparent weak growth in the proportion of people using social network sites is a remarkable change from prior years. We can speculate that this is because of media coverage about privacy issues on social media sites. Or, maybe it shows that we are approaching a natural limit in the number of people interested in such sites.'; \u2022 University of York / Exeter / Newcastle / Bristol / Edinburgh / British Antarctic Survey A team of UK scientists have discovered huge ice channels beneath a floating ice shelf in Antarctica. At 250 metres high, the channels are almost as tall as the Eiffel tower and stretch hundreds of kilometres along the ice shelf. The channels are likely to influence the stability of the ice shelf and their discovery will help researchers understand how the ice will respond to changing environmental conditions. David Rippin, senior lecturer in the environment department at York, says: \"We know very little about the drainage of water beneath the Antarctic ice sheet. However, seeing such large channels in one of the floating ice shelves that surround Antarctica and then seeing that these channels line up with locations where we predict water would outflow from under the Antarctic ice sheet, is strong evidence that channelised drainage exists beneath, at least parts of, this huge ice sheet. This has significant implications for Antarctica's dynamic behaviour.\"; Would you like your university's research featured on the network?
