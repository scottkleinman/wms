In a country where party politics has always sought to control the cultural field, the aim of such war is to wipe out, or at least quarantine, the opposition, its ideology, its language, its notions of independence, and \u2013 in the case of the current administration \u2013 to impose an all-consuming patriotic line whereby only one version of Hungary is allowed to exist.; There is currently the case with the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. The original academy was founded in 1825, chiefly composed of scientists but including some literary figures. In 1949 it was taken over by the Communist party, so after 1989, there was reason to change it again. The academy declared itself an autonomous institution and in 1992 the Sz\u00e9chenyi Academy of Letters and Arts, or Szima was founded as one of its branches. As soon as news of its foundation got around, it was attacked by the right wing and a rival organisation, the Hungarian Academy of the Arts, or MMA was set up, forestalling it by a few months, with the architect Imre Makovecz at the head. Szima invited members, MMA took them on application.; Szima had, and continues to have, the finest writers of the period, including Hungary's four leading novelists, P\u00e9ter Esterh\u00e1zy, Peter N\u00e1das, Imre Kert\u00e9sz, and L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Krasznahorkai, as well as its greatest film directors, Zolt\u00e1n F\u00e1bri, Mikl\u00f3s Jancs\u00f3, K\u00e1roly Makk, M\u00e1rta M\u00e9sz\u00e1ros and Istv\u00e1n Szab\u00f3, not to mention composer Gy\u00f6rgy Kurt\u00e1g and pianist Zolt\u00e1n Kocsis. MMA has a good many artists who applied. But MMA got the money.; From the \"patriotic\" point of view, any art that questions the administration's values or simply negates them is to be distrusted. But since Hungary is still a democratic country the government can't be seen to censor disagreeable material directly. It can't arrest or ban people but it can jettison them and prevent them operating by strangling them financially or by taking over the organisation from the inside.; The list of such strangulations and takeovers is already long. In theatre the ousting of artistic directors and the installation of far-right figures; in the visual arts the encouragement of rightwing art through national competitions and the amalgamation of independent galleries to single institutions more easily controlled by government; in media the attempts to close down independent radio stations. The list in literature is far too long already. There have been attempts to smear Gy\u00f6rgy Konr\u00e1d and to deprive Nobel prizewinner Imre Kert\u00e9sz of his Hungarian identity (now referred to only as being \"of Hungarian extraction\").; There has been the setting up of an expensive new national library to promote Hungarian patriotic values, and the introduction of fascist writers of the 30s and 40s to the school syllabus. Philosophers have been smeared. In March the prestigious T\u00e1ncsics awards were given to three members of the far right \u2013 one of those awarded gave back the prize, under official pressure, the other two kept them. Far-right figures get research centres of their own, while the philosopher Gy\u00f6rgy Luk\u00e1cs's research centre is broken up into general libraries.; Now MMA has been declared the only representative of Hungarian arts. MMA has a clear patriotic agenda. Szima is a non-political organisation and includes supporters of the government. Interestingly enough, the founder and leaders of MMA have been among those to traduce Konr\u00e1d. A couple of months ago the architects association suggested a series of events to commemorate 20 years of Szima. Not only did it receive no funding, but the association is threatened with closure.; But maybe that is not surprising. Istv\u00e1n Klinghammer, the new secretary for higher education, recently declared: \"I think the humanities are important but they don't create values.\" Not the right values perhaps.; Some will say it is just privileged artists moaning about loss of influence. But this is cumulative, part of a process to deprive the opposition of voice and therefore language. Hungary has produced great artists, musicians, architects, film directors and writers. Some of them are still alive. The government wishes to cut them out of the heart of culture. The truth is that the so-called \"patriots\" backed by the Fidesz conservative party are not the image of the nation: they want the nation to be the image of them.\n",
