Sunday 10 February 2013 16.00 EST	No justice for student protesters Alfie Meadows and Zak King		More than two years after the student protests of December 2010, two young men, Alfie Meadows and Zak King, are still waiting to clear their names after being prosecuted on charges of violent disorder (Letters, 21 November 2012). We condemn the use of such a serious charge against protesters. We also believe that a two-year lapse between the events to which the charges relate and the trial is unacceptable. Alfie and Zak have not been free to live their lives as they would have chosen, but have had to live under the constant fear that they would spend a lengthy period in prison (violent disorder carries a five-year maximum term).; Alfie and Zak now find themselves in the extraordinary position of facing a third trial after a jury failed to reach a decision in their first trial and their retrial collapsed after repeated delays. While we do not blame anybody for the outcome of the previous hearings, no one should have to wait so long for justice to be done. We deplore a criminal justice system such as this, which leaves protesters' lives on hold while they wait to clear their names, and the families of those individuals who have died at the hands of police waiting endlessly for justice for their loved ones. We call on the CPS to discontinue the prosecution.
