In essence, Glasson implores people to think locally as they select Kevin Rudd\u2019s replacement for the inner-south Brisbane seat.; Glasson is visiting West End\u2019s The Three Monkeys, a cafe in one of the more progressive parts of the inner-south electorate that Rudd has held since 1998. He is accompanied by the federal treasurer, Joe Hockey, who likens the eclectic decor to a scene from Casablanca. Visitors play chess and read newspapers as they sip on their teas or coffees.; \u201cIt\u2019s not about changing the government,\u201d Glasson tells locals in an attempt to head off Labor\u2019s characterisation of him as an apologist for Abbott and Newman\u2019s budget cuts.; \u201cIt\u2019s not about changing the prime minister; it\u2019s not about changing the treasurer; it\u2019s about electing the new member for Griffith.\u201d; Hockey, one of a several senior ministers to lend their support to Glasson\u2019s campaign, watches on in bemusement. \u201cYou certainly don\u2019t want to encourage changing the treasurer,\u201d he quips, prompting laughter.; The byelection triggered by Rudd\u2019s resignation shapes as the first electoral test for the Abbott government, which has suffered a decline in popularity in opinion polls since it swept to power in September. Glasson\u2019s Labor rival, the Maurice Blackburn employment lawyer Terri Butler, is favoured by bookies, pundits and history to win the seat. It has been nearly 100 years since a government has wrested a seat from an opposition at a federal byelection, leading the high-profile Glasson to claim the cherished \u201cunderdog\u201d status. Still, Glasson requires a swing of just 3% and history is no guarantee of future results.; The LNP\u2019s efforts to frame the contest largely around Glasson\u2019s credentials rather than contentious national disputes are unmistakable.; Two hours after using a radio interview to declare the end of the age of entitlement, Hockey lauds Glasson as \u201ca man of immense integrity\u201d. The treasurer describes the LNP hopeful as forthright, considered, intelligent, \u201ca giver\u201d and potentially the best member for Griffith since the seat was created in 1934. Glasson is a medical doctor and opthamologist who gained a public profile through his past role as president of the Australian Medical Association.; But Butler\u2019s campaign is seeking protest votes, based on the unpopularity of Abbott and Newman in the electorate. The last thing Australia needs, argues Butler, is another \u201crubber stamp\u201d for LNP cuts. The Glasson campaign has countered with flyers in people\u2019s letter boxes warning against electing \u201cyet another Labor union lawyer\u201d acting as a factional puppet. It comes amid allegations of misconduct involving construction union officials. Voters would be better off with a voice inside government that could influence Abbott\u2019s team, the LNP argues.; Butler says the criticism is a bit rich \u201ccoming from the former head of the doctors\u2019 union\u201d, insisting her work for unions was aimed at achieving safer and fairer workplaces.; \u201cIn my professional capacity I\u2019ve worked for almost every union,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve worked for blue-collar unions, white-collar unions, left-wing unions, right-wing unions, I\u2019ve done work for firefighters, nurses, administrative assistants, ambulance workers, traffic controllers.\u201d; Butler introduces herself to voters at Morningside Central, a shopping centre near her home. As Butler talks about her campaign\u2019s focus on being a strong advocate against cuts, a man walks past carrying shopping bags and declares: \u201cYou\u2019ve definitely got my vote.\u201d; \u201cI should think so,\u201d Butler replies. She explains that the supporter is her husband, Troy Spence, an Australian Workers\u2019 Union official.; Rather than a debate over unions, Labor would prefer to focus on the government\u2019s \u201ccommission of audit\u201d led by the Business Council of Australia president, Tony Shepherd. The party has sought to draw comparisons with a similar exercise commissioned by Newman in 2012. The state commission of audit, headed by the former Howard government treasurer Peter Costello, sounded dire warnings over the state\u2019s debt and deficit trajectory, providing political cover for Queensland LNP to pursue outsourcing and cut some 14,000 public sector positions.; Against this backdrop, Labor has latched onto a proposal submitted to the national commission to introduce a new $6 fee for bulk-billed GP visits, a tactic denounced by the prime minister, Tony Abbott, as a baseless \u201cscare campaign\u201d. The co-payment was advocated by Terry Barnes, a former policy adviser to Abbott when he was health minister, as a way of ensuring people valued the services they received.; Glasson told the ABC in early January that he supported \u201can affordable price signal\u201d while stressing the need \u201cto make sure it wouldn\u2019t impact on the most vulnerable in our society\u201d.; Butler says many people have family members who put off going to see the doctor \u2013 a situation that would only be worsened by a \u201creckless\u201d new fee. She argues Labor is entitled to campaign strongly against the \u201cGP tax\u201d given the government\u2019s refusal to categorically rule it out. Butler opens up about her father\u2019s close call with melanoma that had metastasised. She says a friend who was a doctor suggested he needed to get it checked.; \u201cHad that not occurred \u2026 he would have died,\u201d Butler says.; \u201cIn 2007, my uncle, a person who never went to the GP, had a sore back, put up with it for ages; by the time they looked into it they realised it was a secondary tumour from cancer \u2013 a cancer throughout his body. He was diagnosed in January; he died in May and my aunt had to live through that. Now I don\u2019t want to see any policy \u2013 and this is why I\u2019ve got such a strong view about it \u2013 that makes people less likely to seek medical help early particularly not those sort of blue-collar blokes who already don\u2019t want to go to the GP.\u201d; Abbott, on the first of his two campaign visits to Griffith, stresses Glasson\u2019s experiences helping disadvantaged people in western Queensland and East Timor with their eyesight. Abbott tells hundreds of LNP supporters at a launch event that he has \u201cnever met a man with better or purer motives for going into the parliament\u201d.; The prime minister is asked to guarantee he will not introduce a GP co-payment. Instead, Abbott says: \u201cNothing is being considered, nothing has been proposed, nothing is planned.\u201d; Glasson says he has a history of being \u201can extremely strong advocate in health\u201d and would not be afraid of speaking out forcefully on issues he felt strongly about. When he was AMA president he worked with the then health minister, Abbott, \u201cto boost bulk-billing\u201d. Glasson says the medical model must protect the most vulnerable: children, pensioners, the poorest and the sickest.; \u201cThat\u2019s our prime responsibility,\u201d Glasson says after a shopping centre walkthrough with the communications minister, Malcolm Turnbull.; \u201cBulk-billing should reflect the needs of those people who can\u2019t afford an out-of-pocket expense, so I\u2019d fight tooth and nail to ensure that those people are protected. There\u2019s no greater advocate of the Medicare system than Bill Glasson.\u201d; The Greens candidate, Geoff Ebbs, describes Glasson as \u201cpersonable\u201d but says the minor party will again be recommending preferences for Labor over the LNP because of the Abbott government\u2019s \u201cshocking\u201d performance, including on climate change and the environment.; Glasson led Rudd 42.2% to 40.4% on primary votes last September, but the Labor incumbent surged to 53% after the distribution of preferences, largely the result of Greens preference flows.; Ebbs, who attracted more than 10% support, says many people are ashamed at the major parties\u2019 treatment of asylum seekers. \u201cPeople are saying things like, I grew up to believe in hospitality; when someone knocks on your door you give them a cup of tea, hear their story and decide whether to provide further help,\u201d he says.; Ebbs is having coffee with the former Catholic priest Peter Kennedy, who was ejected from St Mary\u2019s in South Brisbane in 2009 over unorthodox practices and now leads the breakaway \u201cSt Mary\u2019s In Exile\u201d community. Kennedy says Rudd supported the St Mary\u2019s-linked Micah Projects in efforts to combat homelessness, but his pre-election Papua New Guinea asylum seeker processing deal was \u201cbeyond belief\u201d.; Butler says a regional solution is an \u201cobvious necessity\u201d because people will flee persecution while there is conflict in the world. She says she does not support policy settings that would act as an incentive for people to take dangerous risks at sea, but suggests Australia\u2019s humanitarian intake is low by international standards.; \u201cI think if you\u2019re on the border of Syria and you have one of those mega-camps, you\u2019d be looking at Australians and wondering what they\u2019re complaining about when it comes to asylum seekers,\u201d Butler says.; Glasson wants to discourage perilous boat journeys but says he is concerned about children in detention.; \u201cThey need to be processed as quickly as possible, I agree and, like the AMA, do not support holding children in detention centres because I think it is not healthy for them mentally and it\u2019s not good for them socially, but we\u2019ve inherited this problem from Labor and we\u2019re trying to fix it up and we will,\u201d he says.; Refugee policy is raised at an Australian Christian Lobby forum, as is same-sex marriage. Glasson tells the gathering that in the event of a conscience vote he would support equality \u201cfor all Australians\u201d.; \u201cI look at the issues of trust, love, commitment,\u201c he tells the 50 attendees at the Greenslopes Baptist Church. \u201cYou know I have people of the same sex come up to me just about in tears because they want and desire to get married. And I say to myself, OK, I\u2019ve got strong Christian views but why should I let my views interfere with two people of the same sex who want to get married - not in a church?\u201c; Some parts of the electorate are voting for the fifth time in two years after a run of federal, state and council elections. Several voters shopping at Morningside Central two days before polling day tell Guardian Australia they are unhappy about being sent back to the polls so soon. \u201cI\u2019m entirely sick of all the paper in my letterbox,\u201d one shopper says.; A Norman Park resident says he is disappointed with Rudd\u2019s rapid resignation but will not support the LNP because it is \u201cgoing a bit nuts\u201d at the state level. A Hawthorne man says Glasson is the best candidate and will get rid of the carbon tax (Abbott says people who want cost of living relief should vote LNP and send a message to the Labor leader, Bill Shorten). Another resident, Gideon of Morningside, will back Labor because of the Abbott government\u2019s \u201chorrible\u201d environmental record.; The political commentator Paul Williams, a senior lecturer at Griffith University\u2019s school of humanities, believes Labor will fall over the line, but it will be close. Glasson is \u201cvery well received\u201d in the electorate but he will suffer from national issues and a lack of preference flows from parties other than Katter\u2019s Australian party and Family First. Eleven candidates are on the ballot paper.; \u201cThere\u2019s two massive competing forces here; no one should be surprised if Dr Glasson loses by 0.5% or wins by 0.5%,\u201d Williams says.; Clive Bean, professor of political science at the Queensland University of Technology, says Glasson, a strong established candidate, might previously have been considered capable of \u201ccarrying on the momentum\u201d after achieving a 5.5% swing in September, but the Abbott government\u2019s honeymoon had ended quickly.; \u201cI probably would have said a couple of months ago this case might be an exception [to the byelection trend]; now it\u2019s looking like it won\u2019t be,\u201d Bean says.",
