While there is likely to be broad appreciation for the collection\u2019s artistic importance, its international importance to post-medieval archaeology may be less well known. Among post-medieval archaeology\u2019s core areas of interest are the study of such topics as artefacts of the post-1500 modern world, globalisation and the spread of capitalism, and the industrial revolution. The Wedgwood collection is a priceless research resource for all of these issues. Wherever post-medieval archaeologists work on sites dating to the later 18th and 19th centuries \u2013 whether in Great Britain, Ireland, and Europe, or further afield in North America, South America, Africa, Australasia, or even the desert oases of the Persian Gulf \u2013 one of the most common and important artefact types we recover are the British ceramic types pioneered, produced, and inspired by Josiah Wedgwood and his successors.; The loss of this important research collection would therefore have a devastating impact not just on the artistic heritage of Britain, but also on period research in the humanities internationally. In keeping with our goal of supporting relevant research, the SPMA has made a modest donation to the campaign in the welcome knowledge that the first \u00a3500,000 of donations will be matched. Individual council members have also made donations, and we hope that your readers will likewise lend their support to this important cause.
