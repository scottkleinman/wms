She has to choose what to take in the next month, is good at maths and enjoys studying both science and humanities	Twice a week we publish problems that will feature in a forthcoming Dear Jeremy advice column in the Saturday Guardian so that readers can offer their own advice and suggestions. We then print the best of your comments alongside Jeremy’s own insights. Here is the latest dilemma – what are your thoughts?; My 15-year-old daughter has to choose in the next month or so what A-levels to take. She has no real preference for the arts or sciences, as she is good at both. She has an A-level in Japanese, plus GCSEs in Japanese, Latin and statistics and is studying for nine more this year. She is bilingual, good at maths, and she likes both arts and science subjects. She has good communication and empathy skills.; There seems so little advice on how to make this difficult choice. Her teachers know she’s really organised so aren’t too concerned. She has started exploring some personality/careers tests online.; With only a month to go what can you and your readers recommend? I hated having to choose myself as I enjoyed both sciences and arts. I wish the exam system would be changed to allow this crucial decision to be made a few years later, as it is in other countries.; Do you need advice on a work issue?
