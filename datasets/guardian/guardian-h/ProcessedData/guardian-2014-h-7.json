Previously, they could only guess what colours huge reptiles had. Gareth Dyke, senior lecturer in vertebrate palaeontology at the University of Southampton, one of the scientists who made the discovery, says: \"The most sensational aspect of the investigation is that it can now be established that these ancient marine reptiles were, at least partially, dark-coloured in life, something that probably contributed to more efficient thermoregulation, as well as providing means for camouflage and protection against harmful UV radiation.\" Per Uvdal, co-author of the study, says: \"Our discovery enables us to make a journey through time and to revisit these ancient reptiles using their own biomolecules. Now, we can finally use sophisticated molecular and imaging techniques to learn what these animals looked like and how they lived.\" Ancient marine life such as ichthyosaurs and mosasaurs died out during the Cretaceous period, but leatherback turtles are still around today. Their almost entirely black back could be a reason for their survival, as it enables them to heat up faster and reach higher body temperatures than if they had been lightly coloured.; Scientists have discovered a new way to study the mechanisms that cause breast cancer cells to spread to the bone. Although more women than ever before are surviving breast cancer, 1,000 UK women are still dying from the disease each month. The majority of these deaths are caused by the metastatic form, also known as secondary breast cancer. Recent discoveries have shown that metastasis (the process of cancer cells leaving the breast and spreading to other parts of the body) may occur early during the development of the disease, with tumour cells moving around the body before invading tissues and remaining dormant until awakened later on. Andrew Tutt, unit director, says: \"We have created a new experimental model that can be used to chart forms of tumour cell dormancy. Our model successfully recreates the conditions that cause metastatic breast cancer cells to reside in the bone and become dormant enabling us to learn more about, and ultimately hope to prevent, the progression of metastatic breast cancer.\"; \u2022 University of Cambridge Scientists say the resurrection of extinct animals, such as the woolly mammoth and passenger pigeon, is a strong possibility. William Sutherland, in the department of zoology, says: \"There has been discussion of this idea for some time but it is now looking more practical and the idea is being taken seriously.\" There are concerns, however, that such a high-profile project could lead to attention and resources being diverted from attempts to thwart current threats to non-extinct species' survival. Sutherland adds: \"A key issues is whether this is really a conservation priority.\" Though the last woolly mammoth died around 4000 years ago, methods such as back-breeding, cloning and genetic engineering may lead to their resurrection. Not only could these extinct animals, and others such as the thylacine and the passenger pigeon, be reconstructed and returned to their native environments, they could potentially be used to \"provide tools for outreach and education\".; \u2022 Nottingham Trent University Video gaming can distort your vision and perception of real life objects, research shows. In a study, gamers reported seeing video game menus popping up in front their eyes when they were in a conversation, or saw coloured images and displays when driving on the motorway after they had stopped playing. \"Some gamers may be more susceptible than others to experience Game Transfer Phenomena (GTP),\" says Mark Griffiths, director of the International Gaming Research Unit. \"The effects of these experiences appear to be short-lived, but some gamers experience them recurrently. More research is needed to understand the cognitive and psychological implications of GTP.\" The findings also raise questions about the effects of the exposure to certain visual effects used in video games.; \u2022 University of Manchester German speaking Jewish intellectuals, many of whom met in the coffee houses of Berlin, Vienna and Prague, were among the first to see their identity as European, finds literary and film scholar Cathy Gelbin. \"Rather than sidelining this important contribution, as has been the case in recent public discussions, perhaps the time has come for their role to be recognised,\" says Gelbin. \"Even before the onset of Nazism, German-speaking Jews were seen as either too assimilated on the one hand, but too international on the other. This anti-Semitism, in all but name, had a profound effect on the community, rejecting the accepted definition of their own German and Austrian identities.\" She adds: \"Jewish Zionists called for a separate homeland, whereas others insisted their identity was not merely Jewish or German, but one beyond ethnicity and national borders.\" The study revealed a remarkable culture of cosmopolitanism, which despite the onslaught of Nazism, has survived into modern times.; \u2022 Institute of Education Local authorities say placing children in residential care far from home can help stop risky behaviour, such as child sexual exploitation, offending behaviour, and involvement with gangs and guns. Charlie Owen, from the Institute of Education, says: \"A number of reports have expressed concern over the vulnerability of teenage girls being placed in children's homes a long way from their communities. We found that local authorities accounted for out of area placements in terms of either meeting specialist needs or to move children from the local area to break the cycle of risky behaviour. However, more needs to be done to ensure the safety of these children a long way from home.\"; Would you like your university's research featured on the network?
