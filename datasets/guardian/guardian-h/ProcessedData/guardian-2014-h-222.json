Is a fashion postgrad the right path for you? \u2022 Read more from our hub for postgraduate students here\tYes. No. Maybe. It depends on what \u2013 and who \u2013 you know already.; Education can be the greatest inspiration. Good university tutors will teach you how to think critically, even more so on a master\u2019s course because you are beginning to hone your craft and specialise.; But then there are the costs, the competition, and the underlying question: is it really worth it, in an industry where talent is usually valued above formal education?; There are those types that got full marks for every piece they handed in at Central Saint Martins College, who are \u2013 deservedly \u2013 in impressive jobs. But there are also those who worked their way into equally great jobs through internships, apprenticeships and just saying \u201cyes\u201d to opportunities.; Karla Stevens, who graduated from Leeds in June with a BA in fashion concepts and communication, was put off doing an MA by the fees (which now range from \u00a37,500 to \u00a310,000).; \u201cI looked into doing a master\u2019s, but it isn\u2019t something I could afford,\u201d she says. Instead, Karla moved to London and started an internship at Little White Lies magazine, which resulted in a full-time job.; Laura Hinson, showcasing manager at the British Fashion Council, agrees that internships and work placements are a good way of finding work. She says: \u201cMy master\u2019s tutor was able to introduce us to a really well-connected group of people, which resulted in an internship and a permanent job for me.; \u201cHowever, with the increase in tuition fees, I would now recommend placements and internships as a more effective way of starting a career.\u201d; Dame Vivienne Westwood once told the Guardian, \u201cI wanted to have fun with men, and [only] geeks went to college.\u201d Rei Kawakubo never studied design and neither did Miuccia Prada; she graduated in political sciences. Raf Simons studied industrial design. Tom Ford studied architecture.; So is a master\u2019s \u2013 or indeed any formal education in fashion \u2013 an expensive attempt to learn the unlearnable?; \u201cQualifications in design are not necessary as there is never really a right or wrong answer,\u201d say menswear designers Agi and Sam. \u201cApprenticeships are great as they can make you aware of how to logistically do something, but they won\u2019t teach you how to be creative. A master\u2019s can enable you to really understand your personal handwriting; it can take a long time to realise this as a creative.\u201d; If were it not for my own master\u2019s in fashion, there\u2019s absolutely no chance I would have worked in the industry. While nobody has ever asked what qualifications I have in a fashion job interview, the education part, for us geeks born without the creative genius gene, is necessary.; Course leader for MA fashion journalism at the London College of Fashion, Andrew Tucker, looks for students with an interest in fashion that goes beyond Vogue. \u201cI look for students who have a really interesting take on fashion, and who understand how fascinating it is.; \u201cIt\u2019s a subject that goes from fashion shows to Rana Plaza in Bangladesh. If you\u2019re really interested in fashion, you\u2019re interested in its entirety, its past and its future.; \u201cI look for people who are prepared to put themselves out there, who have balls, who are ambitious and have a sense of humour. I look for someone who I really think I can teach and at the end of it, they\u2019ll have a broader world-view of fashion and what it entails, and be able to carve a career in it.\u201d; Alexander McQueen learned to cut patterns during an apprenticeship at Savile Rowe. Only after applying to Central Saint Martins to be a tutor, was he encouraged to enroll as a student.; Which should give hope to non-graduates interested in master\u2019s degrees who don\u2019t already have a degree in the bag. \u201cOfficially we request a 2:1 or above,\u201d says Tucker, \u201cunless someone has a really interesting story and they can demonstrate a wealth of industry experience. I have accepted people who haven\u2019t got a degree and rejected people who got a first.\u201d; If you do decide to take a master\u2019s course, there is no need to jump into it immediately. Waiting a while after you graduate is a good idea, in order to save money and get some experience. Isabel Nascimento, currently in her final year at Nottingham Trent, studying fashion communication and promotion says:; \u201cWorking in the field first makes it easier to find your passion, which can be developed with a master\u2019s course later on. After three years of academic work, all I want to do is go out there and experience real life.\u201d; Caryn Franklin, fashion expert, TV personality, former i-D editor and co-founder of the award-winning All Walks Beyond the Catwalk, has just become a student again \u2013 studying for her masters in fashion psychology. She says: \u201cA master\u2019s offers the chance for critical reflection and to specialise.; \u201cIn fashion, visionary innovators and thought leaders are those with the ability to challenge the existing dynamic and suggest improvement. That is how our industry will progress. Desirable employers looking for difference among graduates may recognise that further study can allow for the opportunity to build the necessary confidence to do this.\u201d; If you think you can do it without a master\u2019s, that probably means you can. But for those left wondering after an undergraduate degree, or stuck in a call centre \u2013 sketching collections, an MA can make all the difference. And being able to call yourself a master of arts is quite nice too.; \u2022 How to get funding for your arts and humanities postgrad; \u2022 Graduate in a dead-end job? Perhaps it\u2019s time to go back to uni; \u2022 Will doing a masters get you a better job? Well, maybe...; \u2022 It\u2019s alright to change career direction at postgraduate level",
