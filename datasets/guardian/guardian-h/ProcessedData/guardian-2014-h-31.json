The war, and the peace that has ensued, both overseen by international observers, have only emboldened the local ethno-nationalist partitocracy in BH, which \u2013 shielded by fears of new wars and new violence \u2013 proceeded to enrich itself in the country with the official youth unemployment rate of 57%. Not surprisingly, the wave of recent protests throughout Bosnia, which started in Tuzla, a working-class city, is focusing on job opportunities, pensions, health benefits, confiscation of illegally obtained property and formation of non-ethnic or technocratic governments. No demands are made based on ethnicity, religion, or any divisions that characterise BH in the stubborn international stereotype of it.; As academics and scholars of the region, we call upon the international community to recognise alternative modes of political organising emerging in Bosnia, acknowledging at last that they are not all based on ethnicity. After repeatedly calling on Bosnians to take the fate of their country into their own hands, the international community should now extend their support to protesters and seriously consider their demands. In spring 1992, Bosnian citizens staged in Sarajevo the largest demonstrations ever against all nationalist parties. They were silenced by snipers, and their voices, from that point on, ignored by the international community. This time, the world should listen.; Aida A Hozi\u0107 University of Florida, United States, Florian Bieber University of Graz, Austria, Eric Gordy University College London, Chip Gagnon Ithaca College, United States, Eldar Sarajli\u0107 Central European University, Hungary, Tanja Petrovi\u0107 Research Center of the Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts, Slovenia, Ana Devi\u0107 Fatih University, Turkey, Andr\u00e1s Boz\u00f3ki Central European University, Hungary, Jo Shaw Edinburgh University, Scotland Jasmin Mujanovi\u0107 York University, Canada, Valerie Bunce Cornell University, United States, Konstantin Kilibarda York University, Canada, Aleksandra Mili\u010devi\u0107 University of North Florida, United States, Emel Akcali Central European University, Hungary, Olimpija Hristova Zaevska Balkan Institute for Faith and Culture, Macedonia, Jana Ba\u0107evi\u0107 Aarhus University, Denmark Jelena Vasiljevi\u0107 University of Belgrade, Serbia, Michael Bernhard University of Florida, United States, Tea Temim NASA/University of Maryland, United States Jasmina Opardija-Susnjar University of Fribourg, Germany, Julianne Funk Centre for Research on Peace and Development, KU Leuven, Belgium Hanns Schneider Former researcher at University of Jena, Germany, William Risch Georgia College, United States, Kiril Avramov New Bulgarian University in Sofia, Bulgaria, Tom Junes German Historical Institute in Warsaw, Poland, Tibor T Meszmann Working Group on Public Sociology 'Helyzet' Budapest, Hungary, B\u00e9la Greskovits Central European University, Hungary, Hilde Katrine Haug University of Oslo, Norway and Harriman Institute, Columbia University, Armina Galija\u0161 University of Graz, Austria Zoltan Dujisin Columbia University, United States Heleen Touquet University of Leuven, Belgium, Amila Buturovi\u0107 York University, Canada, Margareta Kern Artist, London, United Kingdom Valerie Bunce Cornell University, United States, Catherine Baker University of Hull, United Kingdom, Adriana Zaharijevi\u0107 University of Belgrade, Maja Lovrenovi\u0107 VU Universiteit Amsterdam, The Netherlands Marko Prelec Balkans Policy Research Group, Pristina, Kosovo, Claudiu Tufi\u0219 University of Bucharest, Romania, Gal Kirn Humboldt Universit\u00e4t zu Berlin, Germany, Keziah Conrad University of California, Los Angeles, United States Jarrett Blaustein Aberystwyth University, United Kingdom Igor \u0160tiks University of Edinburgh, United Kingdom Rossen Djagalov Ko\u00e7 University, Turkey, Paul Stubbs Institute for Economics, Zagreb, Croatia, Davor Marko University of Belgrade, Serbia, Ljubica Spaskovska University of Exeter, United Kingdom, Christian Axboe Nielsen Aarhus University Andrej Gruba\u010di\u0107 California Institute of Integral Studies, United States, Wendy Bracewell University College London, United Kingdom, Zhidas Daskalovski University of Bitola, Macedonia, Nicole Lindstrom University of York, United Kingdom, Hristina Cipusheva South East European University, Republic of Macedonia, Marina Anti\u0107 University of Pittsburgh, United States Alen Kristi\u0107 University of Graz, Austria, Julija Sardeli\u0107 University of Edinburgh, United Kingdom, Lara J Nettelfield Royal Holloway, University of London, United Kingdom, Ivana Krstanovi\u0107 Faculty of Philosophy, University of Sarajevo, Danijela Majstorovi\u0107 University of Banja Luka, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Zoran Vu\u010dkovac University of Alberta, Canada, Elissa Helms Central European University, Hungary, Igor Cveji\u0107 Institut za filozofiju i dru\u0161tvenu teoriju Beograd, Serbia Slavoj \u017di\u017eek Birkbeck Institute for the Humanities, United Kingdom, Nata\u0161a Bek Josip Juraj Strossmayer University of Osijek, Croatia, Sladjana Lazi\u0107 Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Norway, Katarina Peovi\u0107 Vukovi\u0107 Faculty of Philosophy, Rijeka, Croatia, Artan Sadiku Institute of social sciences and humanities -

Their cry for a decent life, true democracy, solidarity that knows no borders \u2013 be they ethnic, national or religious \u2013 resonates throughout the world. In a similar fashion to the citizens of Tahrir, Taksim or Syntagma, the Bosnian protesters showed a courage to go beyond institutional obstacles and all limitations that governments around the world impose on their citizens and reclaimed their streets. The people of BH are standing against the system of exploitation, injustice and inequality that has been serving only a tiny political, economic and financial elite. A century after the assassination of Franz Ferdinand, when imperialist European leaders pushed their nations into mutual destruction, Bosnia is sending a wake-up call to everyone. The world we live in is a world of divisions, expanding fascism, growing political and social apartheid, unrelenting capitalist destruction of both nature and common wealth of all. The citizens of BH have been experiencing all of that on an everyday level for 20 years. After the nationalist war between 1992 and 1995, in which 100,000 people lost their lives, the institutional peace settlement restored the capitalist system, destroyed the working and middle classes, and entrenched not only ethnic but also social divisions that have been successfully exploited by political elites. They said \"enough\" and we say \"enough\" with them. We voice our support for their legitimate efforts to create a just and equal society in Bosnia-Herzegovina. We call upon all progressive political and social forces to stand with the people of Bosnia-Herzegovina in this decisive struggle for a better future of us all.; Tariq Ali Writer and social activist, UK Gil Anidjar Scholar, University of Columbia, USA, Vladimir Arsenijevi Writer, Serbia, Etienne Balibar Professor emeritus, University Paris Ouest, France, Franco Berardi Bifo Philosopher, Italy, Alida Bremer Writer, Germany, Wendy Brown Political theorist, UC BUSA, Boris Buden Univeristy of Weimar, Germany, Noam Chomsky Linguist and social activist, MIT, USA, Goran Fejic Writer, France, Karl-Markus Gauss Writer, Austria, Costas Douzinas Philosopher, Birkbeck, University of London, UK, Daa Drndi Writer, Croatia, Michael Hardt Philosopher, Duke University, USA, David Harvey Geographer, CUNY, USA, Aleksandar Hemon Writer, USA, Sreko Horvat Philosopher, Croatia, Saa Ili Writer, Serbia, Rada Ivekovic Philosopher, University St Etienne, France, Mate Kapovi Linguist, University of Zagreb, Croatia, Naomi Klein Author and social activist, USA, Maurizio Lazzarato Philosopher, France, Christian Marazzi Economist, Switzerland, Antonio Negri Philosopher, Italy/France, Andrej Nikolaidis Writer, Bosnia and Herzegovina/Montenegro, Nigel Osborne Professor emeritus, University of Edinburgh, Scotland, UK, Costas Lapavitsas Economist, SOAS, UK, Renata Salecl Philosopher, Slovenia, Elke Schmitter Writer, Germany, Ingo Schulze Writer, Germany, Igor Tiks University of Edinburgh, Bosnia and Herzegovina/Scotland/UK, Eric Toussaint Economist, CADTM, Belgium, Yanis Varoufakis Economist, University of Texas, USA, Jasmila Bani Film director, Bosnia and Herzegovina",
