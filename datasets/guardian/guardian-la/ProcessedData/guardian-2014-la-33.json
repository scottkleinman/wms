Rhik Samadder talks to five of the 61 gifted students embarking on a great adventure this autumn\tFor most of us, the great American universties are a mystery \u2013 we know Harvard, Yale, Brown and Princeton as the oak-panelled nurseries of presidents and social-media tycoons. They are stunningly expensive, with fees of up to $60,000 (\u00a337,580) per year dwarfing those in the UK. Studying there can seem an impossible dream.; For those with ambition but no trust fund, there is the Sutton Trust, which promotes social mobility through education. Through a scheme it piloted last year with the Fulbright Commission\u2019s US-UK exchange programme, 61 state-school students from Britain travelled across the Atlantic in September to enroll. The scheme targets students from families with low annual incomes, the majority with less than \u00a325,000.; Many will be the first in their family to go to university. Their lives are about to be turned upside down as they swap jobs in McDonald\u2019s for Nobel laureate tutors and apartments on Broadway. Will it be four years of keg parties and developing strange hybrid accents? Or 3,000 miles of homesickness? We met five of the brightest just before they left to ask what they are looking forward to and what they are nervous about.; From Witham, Essex Going to Barnard College, Columbia University \u201cI think I\u2019ll put a massive Union Jack on my wall so everyone knows I\u2019m British,\u201d says Jouja Maamri, keen to preserve her identity. \u201cLosing my accent worries me. We met one guy who\u2019d just finished four years there and kept switching between British and American sounds. \u2018A cup of cwoorfy?\u2019 I don\u2019t want that!\u201d; At Barnard, the distinguished women\u2019s college of Columbia University, Maamri intends to pursue a lifelong interest in politics. \u201cI watched Channel 4 news a lot when I was young. We weren\u2019t allowed to watch much else. I\u2019d write headline reports for Mum and Dad.\u201d Her current weekly schedule \u2013 participating in a local film club, writing for the college paper, work at a pharmacy and charity fundraising \u2013 chimes with the US emphasis on extracurriculars and internships. \u201cThere\u2019s often this catch-22, where people come out of university with the right degree but none of the experience. I want practical knowledge.\u201d; While her father returned to his native Algeria in 2010, Jouja remained in Essex with her mother and little brother. \u201cEven though I\u2019m from a small town, I\u2019ve never experienced any racism. Hopefully in New York I\u2019ll be shielded from any ignorance. There\u2019s lots of Muslims at Barnard, too, though in fact it\u2019s very Jewish \u2013 lots of kosher meal plans. My grandparents are Jewish, so it\u2019ll be nice to know more about those roots.\u201d; She knows it will be a challenging course. \u201cYou don\u2019t get the relatively easy first year some people have in the UK: from December I\u2019ll start exams which all count towards my final,\u201d she says \u2013 but it won\u2019t be all work and no play. \u201cI\u2019ll have a Broadway address, rent-free, for four years. I intend to make the most of it!\u201d And what the process has taught her most is that she is valued. \u201cI was applying not only for a space, but also for $250,000 (\u00a3156,000). So they want me there \u2013 they\u2019re willing to pay that amount for me to go. It does make you feel special.\u201d; From Borehamwood, Hertfordshire Going to Yale \u201cWhen I applied, I\u2019d never been out of the country, didn\u2019t have a passport, never been on an aeroplane,\u201d says Paige Cunningham. It was the summer school residential week at Yale that really sold her on the Sutton Trust scheme. \u201cI thought: even if I don\u2019t get in, there\u2019s a free trip to America.\u201d; Paige lives with her mum and sister, who both work in the same call centre. \u201cI\u2019m the first of my family to go to university, apart from maybe a cousin,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople around this area tend to stay here.\u201d Thanks to her school achievements, Paige was offered a place at Oxbridge, but she preferred the experience of the US admissions system. \u201cThey\u2019re basically saying: \u2018We like you as a person.\u2019 I know they wanted me, not just my grades.\u201d; She\u2019s headed back to Yale \u2013 alma mater to four American presidents, 17 Nobel laureates and Hillary Clinton \u2013 to take a double major in philosophy and cognitive science. \u201cBut the liberal arts approach means I can also try neuroscience, biology, philosophy, and history. I\u2019m into volunteering and drama, I want to get involved with reading programmes, singing\u2026\u201d She seems overwhelmed by possibility. \u201cSometimes it hits me and I think: \u2018No, it\u2019s not real! I can\u2019t be going to this amazing place!\u2019\u201d; The wealthy Ivy League institution is \u201cneed blind\u201d \u2013 offers are extended to students before calculating their required financial assistance. \u201cThat was good because I needed a lot. I\u2019m worried about fitting in, but I\u2019m told private students are actually impressed with those on financial aid, because coming from a background of nothing and getting here\u2026 They\u2019re cool with that. I\u2019m hoping there won\u2019t be snobbery. I get on with most people.\u201d; The only thing that\u2019s slightly daunting is being so far from home. \u201cMy sister and I are twins; we\u2019ve never been apart. How am I going to cope on my own?\u201d But the American invitation wasn\u2019t one she could ignore. \u201cIt came out of the blue \u2013 and pretty much my whole future changed.\u201d; From Blackpool Going to Harvard Gemma Collins works at a McDonald\u2019s in Blackpool. She has a second part-time job, volunteers as a fundraiser for a local kids\u2019 football team \u2013 and gets excellent grades at school. She and her mum were shopping in Manchester when she found out she was going to Harvard. \u201cI was in River Island, shaking, trying to get phone reception. I wasn\u2019t expecting to get in, but it turned out they\u2019d emailed me the acceptance offer and it had gone into my junk folder. I just started crying, and jumping up and down.\u201d; Since then she has been flown to America and met some of the undergraduates she\u2019ll soon be studying alongside. \u201cOne of them told me that the floor below him has the son of a Microsoft director. At the back of my mind it does worry me that I\u2019m going for free \u2013 and other people can afford to pay for it. But you can\u2019t shut yourself off and just hang around with your own sort. You have to make the most of your opportunities.\u201d; Blackpool hasn\u2019t, she admits, offered her many of those. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of crime,\u201d she says. \u201cMum\u2019s a single parent, so I\u2019ve felt I had to stay and help. But I\u2019ve also had a timer on my phone counting down the days.\u201d; While the move to the elite university was an unexpected break, her career plans remain the same. \u201cI want to become a teacher \u2013 I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to change. I want to go into challenging schools, like the ones in Blackpool. I want to make a difference.\u201d; From London Going to University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill \u201cI am shy,\u201d admits the softly spoken Ade Olatunde. \u201cBut people look up to those who act, not just talk.\u201d When a teacher advised him to contact the Sutton Trust, he discovered he had just a single day to gather references, and he submitted his application minutes before the deadline.; Ade\u2019s act paid off. He won a place on the Morehead-Cain foundation at the University of North Carolina, where the scholarship criteria demand \u201cmoral force of character and physical vigour\u201d. Ade has both: he\u2019s a dedicated rower and participates in CitySafe, a community-led campaign providing havens for young people at risk of street violence.; He\u2019s also proved he can handle big life changes. \u201cI grew up with my grandmother in Lagos, Nigeria, and joined my mum here when I was 11. America will be less of a culture shock. I watch TV to understand different societies, what makes people laugh.\u201d; He\u2019s philosophical beyond his years, too. \u201cI\u2019m interested in human geographies \u2013 climate change, biodiversity, developing versus first-world issues \u2013 you see the world through different lenses.\u201d He\u2019s pretty matter-of-fact about how this great opportunity has come along. \u201cI may have been chosen because I was black or disadvantaged, a great story \u2013 my assumption is that I\u2019m a good candidate. Either way it\u2019s out of my control. I react the same to good or bad news. Things come and go; there\u2019ll be worse and better days. You keep moving.\u201d; His family was less reserved about his big break. \u201cMy brother and sister were screaming. My mum\u2019s sad, but she always knew I\u2019d do something like this.\u201d And his friends? \u201cThey think it\u2019s gonna be like American Pie! Which it isn\u2019t, unless it\u2019s American Pie: The Library Edition, which no one wants to watch.\u201d; From Methil, Fife Going to Northwestern Tommy\u2019s old school does not have an enviable reputation. \u201cGoogling turns up some not very nice words: chlamydia \u2013 we had an outbreak \u2013 or \u2018worst in Fife\u2019.\u201d It\u2019s these kind of unfair aspersions that annoy Tommy. \u201cWe\u2019re between two universities, St Andrews and Edinburgh, and because we can\u2019t match them gradewise we are seen as a bad school, even though we\u2019ve got fantastic things happening that aren\u2019t necessarily to do with grades. My school sends students to an international space school at Nasa every year, where they plan a mission to Mars. But when you read about us in the paper, you only get bad things.\u201d; Undeserved press notwithstanding, Tommy has always wanted to broaden his horizons. \u201cAround here there\u2019s nothing to do. There\u2019s no clubs or organisations \u2013 we just go to people\u2019s houses and hang out.\u201d; Tommy agonised over the Ucas form that required him to pick one subject, because he excels in so many. \u201cI like maths, English, politics, sciences and history. The UK system is fine if you know what you want to do. If you don\u2019t, you\u2019re kind of stuck.\u201d Being a polymath, Tommy was a natural fit for the US system in which students apply by university rather than subject, trying classes from a choice of hundreds once there. \u201cI spoke to some engineering majors who were all doing a play. I loved that.\u201d; He had a rigorous financial assessment. \u201cIt\u2019s invasive, but universities can\u2019t just throw $60,000 into the air.\u201d But Tommy is not worried about fitting in. At Northwestern, \u201c80% of students are on some amount of aid\u201d.; The biggest draw is the chance to travel. \u201cI don\u2019t want to live in the same place,\u201d he says. \u201cI want to see different things. I won\u2019t miss anything here greatly, except family \u2013 I\u2019ll miss my four-year-old niece. But I\u2019m excited to step off a plane and be somewhere else.\u201d; If you are interested in applying of the programme, please email suttontrust@fulbright.org.uk\n",
