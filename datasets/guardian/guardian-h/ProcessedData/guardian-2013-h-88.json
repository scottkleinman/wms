The researchers looked at how frequently 'mood' words were used through time in a database of more than five million digitised books. The list of words was divided into six categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. Alberto Acerbi from the University of Bristol and lead author of the paper, said: \"We were initially surprised to see how well periods of positive and negative moods correlated with historical events. The Second World War, for example, is marked by a distinct increase in words related to sadness, and a correspondent decrease in words related to joy.\"; \u2022 A team of archaeologists from the University of Southampton shine new light on the carvings of the Easter Island statue Hoa Hakananai'a. The team discovered the carving of the bird beak is short and round, not long and pointed as previously described, allowing the two birdmen on the back of the statue to be marked as male and female, unlocking a narrative story relating to Easter Island's unique birdman cult. They also realised that the statue is one of a few on Easter Island that did not stand on a platform beside the shore.; \u2022 High blood pressure and obesity are no longer confined to wealthy countries, a study by Imperial College London and Harvard School of Public Health, has found. The research shows that the average body mass index of the population is now just as high or higher in middle-income countries. Majid Ezzati at Imperial College London, who led the research, said: \"This study shows that non-communicable diseases are no longer 'diseases of affluence'. They've shifted from being epidemic in rich countries to become a truly international pandemic. If current trends continue, developing countries will be confronted with a rising tide of obesity, diabetes and high blood pressure. Meanwhile, developed countries will continue to face an epidemic of diabetes and high cholesterol.\"; \u2022 Certain types of human papilloma virus (HPV) might actually prevent cervical cancer, according to a study by researchers from the University of Manchester. Ian Hampson, a senior lecturer in Viral Oncology from the University of Manchester who lead the study, said: \"The study suggested one possible explanation for why, in spite of a large increase in the numbers of HPV infections in HIV positive African women, there was not a corresponding increase in numbers of cases of cervical cancer. This could also explain why another African study had actually shown the risk of developing one specific type of cervical cancer actually dropped in HIV-positive women.\"; \u2022 Rising food prices mean that 19% of UK households are regularly going without food to feed their children, according to a study led by a Coventry University academic. The research shows, out of the 1000 households interviewed, 20% said the cost of food was becoming a serious source of stress for themselves and their families, with the proportion rising to 50% in households with an income of \u00a314,000 or less. Moya Kneafsey, co-director of the ARG in Sustainable Agriculture at Coventry University said: \"Our research highlights that food insecurity is a real issue in low income households in the UK. While food is plentiful in wealthy countries, our evidence suggests that consumers continue to be concerned about the safety of food, the trustworthiness of labelling, and their ability to afford nutritious food.\"; \u2022 Compulsory domestic abuse prevention lessons are needed in schools, suggests research from the Universities of Keele, Manchester and Bath. The study looking at 13 to 14-year-olds in 13 Staffordshire schools reveals worrying levels of domestic abuse among young people. Claire Fox, from Keele University, who led this phase of the research said: \"We found that domestic abuse prevention education can be effective in changing girls' and boys' attitudes towards domestic abuse and encouraging more of them to seek help.\"; Research from Royal Holloway University and Princeton University has discovered the emergence of Twitter 'tribes'. The study found tribe-like communities that form on social networking sites have a common interest and developed their own distinctive languages. John Bryden from Royal Holloway, said: \"This means that by looking at the language someone uses, it is possible to predict which community he or she is likely to belong to, with up to 80% accuracy.\"; Would you like your university's research featured on the network?
