8/18/2013	L.A. SEEN;Night and day	Same building, two ways. One image documents everyday life in urban Los Angeles -- doors and gates open for business, people in motion, skid row confluences. At night, as photographer Camilo Jose Vergara says, "The buildings invite you in, but at your own risk." When the sun's up, the painted walls reflect L.A.'s distinctive light, at night, they seem to be its source. And taken together, these photos fill another chapter in the city's endless story of sunshine and noir.;New York photographer Camilo Jose Vergara has been documenting the American urban landscape for four decades, including frequent visits to Los Angeles. In July, he was awarded a National Humanities Medal for "capturing... the vibrant culture of our changing communities... and the enduring spirit that shines through decay." A show of his nighttime Los Angeles photographs opened at the Rose Gallery in Santa Monica on Saturday.;Illustration;Caption: PHOTO: 1917 S.
