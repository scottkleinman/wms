Especially when a big, red beard is involved. They look so improbable, so anachronistic, these guys. Young people today. What do they think they look like? They look like the past \u2013 like Victorians, like something out of the Old Testament. It\u2019s odd.; I like the fact that youth culture still has the power to confound the expectations of older people, make them feel suspicious, even. But I seem to be the only one. No one has a good word to say about hipsters. They\u2019re the canaries in the coal mine of gentrification, with their tongue-and-groove coffee shops, their vintage emporia and their \u201cgourmet burgers\u201d. They\u2019re like living, breathing planning notices: \u201cProperty prices rising here.\u201d; Yet everything about that distinctive sartorial style, to me, screams: \u201cNot the money men! I don\u2019t work in the city! I set myself apart from ruthless modernity!\u201d It\u2019s an odd sort of youthful rebellion, the one that says: \u201cNot that kind of middle-class.\u201d For hipsters are so distinctively, so unforgivably middle-class, so precious, so self-conscious, so keen that everything should be just so \u2013 the beer, the distressed paintwork, the 1970s Danish furniture. At a time when youth had its future trashed by the baby boomers, they can still find time to fret about \u201clifestyle\u201d. WTF?; Hipsters, one assumes, are the Trustafarians de nos jours.How can young people afford to live in London at all, to pay rent or have a mortgage, let alone Shoreditch? It\u2019s a mystery. Why aren\u2019t they so worried about billsand the future that membership of somehappening tribe is neither here or there? Family money. Has to be. Spoilt brats, wanting it all \u2013 to be rich and alternative, with their humanities degrees and their entrepreneurial cereal cafes, their ability to paddle along on their raft of aspiration, seemingly unaware of the hardships of those they displace?; But even the hipsters can only manage the capital for a while. The young middle classes are moving out of London like they haven\u2019t done since the 1960s and 70s, when \u201cwhite flight\u201d was seen as a problem. Cities like Birmingham are already noting the arrival of people with more money than sense, who will attract other people with more money than sense, until the people with more sense than money start finding that this isn\u2019t Kansas any more.; Kansas may be choc-a-block with hipsters too, for all I know. But the most hipster place I\u2019ve even been to is Magazine Street in New Orleans, a long shopping street lined with perfect pastel-painted clapboard, little boutiques and brocante. Post-Katrina, the white middle classes are moving to New Orleans in large numbers, lured by lovely old houses at prices that are cheap to them and ludicrously expensive to the local population. Pick up any edition of the local paper and you\u2019ll find some former New Yorker who moved to New Orleans prior to this influx, making some tortured argument about the great integrity of his own move to the city. I\u2019ve heard it all before.; It\u2019s amazing how the pioneers of gentrification like to insist that they\u2019re no such thing \u2013 abhorring the changes that were wrought when people like them reached critical mass. It\u2019s clung to as a badge of honour, this idea that you aren\u2019t like the others, because you were an early adopter, moving before there was even an artisanal bakery.; Me? I make no apologies. I\u2019m the Typhoid Mary of gentrification. I leave middle-class prosperity in my wake, like the Capitalism Fairy. Both of the places where I used to live in London are now gentrified beyond recognition. I\u2019m in Stockwell now, and have been for 18 years, watching it not-changing around me. The day I move out \u2013 that\u2019ll be the day the faux-Dickensian hardware store moves in, with its faux-Dickensian leaseholder. Hopefully.; For there are worse things than gentrification. There\u2019s international-wealthification. There are big plans down the road from where I live. Huge plans. Some of the biggest plans in Europe. The area along the Thames between Battersea power station and Vauxhall has somehow remained a great swathe of light-industrial land until now. Over the next decade or so, it\u2019s going to be transformed into a dense residential area. A development supposedly based on New York\u2019s meat-packing district is nearly built, next to the new US embassy, which is also nearly built, half-moat and all.; I\u2019ve pored over various plans for this brave new world. On one, Stockwell is labeled \u201cresidential hinterland\u201d. On another, like Here Be Dragons on early maps, it\u2019s \u201careas of deprivation\u201d. Council flats, I think they mean. I had a look at what these new non-council flats would be selling for, and was actually quite pleasantly surprised. A large flat was on the market for just under \u00a3900,000. If you\u2019d told me 15 years ago that a large flat at \u00a3900,000 would make me \u201cpleasantly surprised\u201d, I\u2019d have laughed. But here\u2019s the real laugh \u2013 it sounded far too good to be true, so I looked again. Just under \u00a39,000,000. Of course.; It\u2019s reckoned that this cluster of speculative developments will provide 18,000 new homes. The number of people actually expected to live their actual lives in them is summed up by the number of new secondary schools planned for this area: none. Truly astounding. So be kind to your new hipster neighbours. This is the gargantuan level of greed and madness they\u2019re fleeing. They\u2019re just a part of the problem that\u2019s modest enough to be a tangible, breathing, cupcake-hawking presence in a real economy near you.",
