Thursday 28 November 2013 15.59 EST	Sussex students taking action for us all		Since Tuesday students at Sussex University have been occupying the first floor of Bramber House. This space was occupied last February and is where Chartwells, the company now in charge of outsourced catering services, is operating. The students declare their continuing fight against the outsourcing process and the marketisation of higher education, exemplified most recently by the selling of the student loan book. Student protests in Birmingham, Leeds, Sheffield, York, Brighton, London and Manchester, and statements by the National Union of Students show widespread discontent.; Since 30 October, Occupy Sussex has twice taken action to support us, lecturers and tutors, in our national dispute over fair pay. We consider their actions, and ours next Tuesday, to be part of a broader struggle. One to defend and move towards a model of education that prioritises and financially secures the teaching-staff relationship that makes our universities so attractive.; The injunction obtained in April against the previous occupation cost the university £81,812 in legal fees. Considering the widespread support for the occupation inside and outside the university, and the fact that the injunction banned any unauthorised protest on campus and that it failed to do so, we consider these costs unnecessary and misplaced. We are signing this letter of support to pressure the management to open a dialogue with students and staff over outsourcing, representation, and fair pay. It is important to protect the right to protest at our university and avoid any injunctions that could criminalise protesters and curtail that right for all of us.
