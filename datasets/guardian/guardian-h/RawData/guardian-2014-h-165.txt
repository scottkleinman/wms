In the much-parroted words of its sponsor, Man Group, the Man Booker prize has now "gone global", resembling the Olympics rather than a gathering of former colonies. But this claim is based on the almost purely theoretical possibility that novelists from anywhere writing in English can now be submitted by publishers.; In reality, the Booker map is still missing continental Europe, most of Asia, the Middle East, non-anglophone Africa, all of Latin America. If the prize is serious about going global, a second opening-up will be needed, to admit translated fiction. And if the first longlist under the new rules is any guide, it may have paradoxically become less international, not more, as a result of introducing them.; Last July, the 2013 longlist included five writers from the Commonwealth beyond the UK, including the eventual winner, New Zealand's Eleanor Catton. This time, the equivalent number is just one, Australia's Richard Flanagan, with the difference corresponding neatly to the number of Americans selected.; With notable exceptions, American novelists tend to write about the US, and none of the four – Joshua Ferris, Karen Joy Fowler, Siri Hustvedt, Richard Powers – set their selected books abroad. So although non-western countries are depicted in works by Flanagan, Neel Mukherjee and Joseph O'Neill, there's a marked sense of restricted horizons when set against a 2013 longlist full of travellers and immigrants, and in which Catton, NoViolet Bulawayo, Richard House, Jhumpa Lahiri and Ruth Ozeki all pulled off ambitious intercontinental narratives.; New, too, in 2014 are complicated revised rules governing publishers' entries, which reward the recently successful by giving them more slots than their rivals – for example, the elite group with five or more longlistings in the past five years (Bloomsbury, Cape, Chatto, Faber, Fourth Estate) can submit four novels, plus any by past shortlistees.; Overall, the predictable outcome is a shift towards the old guard of literary imprints advantaged by these seedings, with a small drop in the number of indie publishers represented from five in 2013 to four, but there are striking differences in individual performances. Of the two most successful imprints, with a pair of titles longlisted, Chatto (Flanagan, Mukherjee) is in the top group, but Sceptre (Hustvedt, David Mitchell) is a mere third-tier outfit in Booker terms, entitled to only two submissions.; None of Faber's entries pleased AC Grayling's don-dominated panel, and two second-tier imprints with good enough past form to gain three slots, Harvill Secker and Picador, too, missed out. Cape avoided that humiliation, but as its submissions included Martin Amis, Howard Jacobson, Ian McEwan and at least four others, just getting Jacobson on the list can't be considered a triumph. (Jacobson, incidentally, teaches at Grayling's New College of the Humanities, so the chairman may need to step aside when his novel, J, is discussed at the shortlist meeting.); With its lack of big names and its potential contenders that have yet to be published, the longlist has elicited wildly divergent assessments from bookies, with three different favourites – O'Neill for William Hill, Mukherjee for Ladbrokes and Flanagan for Paddy Power – and agreement only that Mitchell (expertly described in Paddy Power's press release as "the comedian David Mitchell") will be among the front-runners and Ali Smith and Jacobson not far behind.; Their evident bewilderment is good news for literary punters, as it means generous prices are available somewhere for almost all Grayling's 13. Mukherjee, 3/1 at Ladbrokes, is 10/1 at William Hill. O'Neill, William Hill's 4/1 favourite, is rated only 12/1 by the others; and the same bookie offers remarkably friendly odds (20/1) on Joshua Ferris, compared to 8/1 at its rivals. The most spectacular contrast, though, is between views on Flanagan's chances: 4/1 favourite at Paddy Power, but a 16/1 back marker along with Hustvedt and David Nicholls at Ladbrokes. Odds are also available – 2/1 at Ladbrokes, 6/4 at William Hill – on the winner being American.
