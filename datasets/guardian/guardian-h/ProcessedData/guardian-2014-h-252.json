But concerns about its possible use as a CIA \u201cblack site\u201d to jail prisoners facing torture have prompted calls for the government to think again.; The disclosure that Rifkind, chair of the intelligence and security committee (ISC), is to officially request material relating to the UK but redacted in the Senate report follows confirmation that references to Britain\u2019s intelligence agencies were deleted at their request from the document, and that UK government representatives had 24 meetings with members of the US committee responsible for the findings.; Among references to British complicity believed to have been redacted are passages relating to Diego Garcia, triggering speculation that Britain had lobbied the US Senate committee\u2019s members to delete all references to it.; Andrew Tyrie, chair of the all-party parliamentary group on rendition, said any negotiations on the island\u2019s future should address allegations that it was used by the CIA to render terror suspects around the world, possibly with British involvement.; \u201cThe negotiations on the lease can focus minds on establishing the scope and limits of Britain\u2019s involvement, direct or indirect, in extraordinary rendition,\u201d Tyrie said. \u201cWe are talking about kidnap and taking people to places where they may be maltreated or tortured.\u201d; The former Home Office minister, Lib Dem MP Norman Baker, who has taken a close interest in the atoll, said: \u201cAs it comes up for renewal, we need a full explanation of what happened in our name on that island.\u201d; Meanwhile Rifkind, whose committee is conducting Britain\u2019s official inquiry into the UK\u2019s role in torture and rendition, said that he enjoyed \u201cgood relations\u201d with his US counterpart Dianne Feinstein, who led the Senate intelligence committee that produced last week\u2019s bombshell report, although he expected the US government itself would have the final say on how and with whom it shared the redacted material.; Rifkind said: \u201cI am not going to go into the details of how we might try and achieve this, there are various ways we can try and advance it, but at the end of the day the actual decision on the American redacted material is for the Americans to take. One additional point is that the only issues we are going to be asking them about are issues relevant to the United Kingdom. We don\u2019t need to see the whole of their redacted report.\u201d; Rifkind was also keen to underline that new powers given to the committee meant that concerns over its previous inquiry \u2013 which in 2007 found MI5 and MI6 guilty only of \u201cbeing slow\u201d in detecting the rendition programme \u2013 were no longer applicable and that it could access documents now that it previously could not. He also said he hoped the committee\u2019s report might be concluded in 2015, although that would depend on Scotland Yard\u2019s investigation into secret MI6 rendition operations that resulted in Libyan dissidents being abducted and flown to Tripoli, where they were tortured in Muammar Gaddafi\u2019s prisons.; The clandestine abduction operations featuring British intelligence agencies to Libya also involved children, a fact omitted from last week\u2019s Senate report.; In October, police investigating MI6\u2019s involvement in the secret abduction of Libyan suspects handed over a file of evidence to the Crown Prosecution Service. The files are part of Operation Lydd, an investigation into MI6 involvement in rendition of activists in 2004.; Among the child victims of rendition is Khadija al-Saadi, who was 12 when she and her family were \u201crendered\u201d to Gaddafi\u2019s Libya in a joint CIA and MI6 operation. Speaking from Tripoli, where she is now 19 and at university studying humanities, Saadi urged the British government to say sorry for its role in the US torture and rendition programme in the years following 9/11.; \u201cI would like an explanation and an apology from the UK government about what they helped the CIA do to my family; it\u2019s a decade since our ordeal, yet still no one has even said sorry. Britain talks about the importance of human rights, but unless they come to terms with their own involvement in the mistreatment of my family and others like us, people will listen to them less and less.\u201d; Saadi\u2019s family, including three younger siblings, were bundled aboard an aircraft in Hong Kong and flown to Libya in March 2004 following a rendition operation allegedly mounted with the help of MI6. Her father, a prominent Libyan dissident, was tortured by Gaddafi\u2019s security police.; Saadi said: \u201cI still don\u2019t understand why the UK was involved with Gaddafi like this. Everyone knew that he tortured and killed people; how could they kidnap a whole family and \u2018render\u2019 them into his hands?; \u201cI have seen that our story was not told in the US report either. I think it is important that people in Britain and America know that the victims of renditions included children like me.\u201d; Donald Campbell of legal charity Reprieve, which represents Saadi, said: \u201cIt seems blatantly obvious that our agencies should not have been in the business of kidnapping and \u2018rendering\u2019 anyone, let alone young children. Khadija, her family and the British public deserve some answers.\u201d",
