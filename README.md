# WE1S Workflow Manager

This is an early-stage prototype for the WE1S WE1S Workflow Management System. It is still very buggy, but it demonstrates the major functions. It runs on port 5000 with the default `mongo:27017` for MongoDB.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- pymongo (`pip install pymongo`)
- tabulator (`pip install tabulator`)
- tableschema_pandas (`pip install tableschema_pandas`)

Once the app is running, there is a "To Do" page with a list of tasks for future development.
