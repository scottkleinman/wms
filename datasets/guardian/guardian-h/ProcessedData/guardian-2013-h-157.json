The imminent welcoming back to its spiritual and scholarly home of one of the 'great landmarks of human cultural achievement' in Durham \u2013 the Lindisfarne Gospel Book \u2013 has provided a unique opportunity for Durham University to engage in some creative educational outreach activity.; One of our main roles as a university has been to raise awareness within schools about what is arguably the finest and most important western manuscript and everything it represents for North-East culture and heritage.; At the core of the schools' programme is a commitment to bridge classroom teaching to high level academia. The workshops may not take place in a lecture theatre but by developing a sense of critical enquiry and expressing opinions, the children are told that they are learning similar skills to undergraduates. The content of some of the workshops comprises high level Durham University research filtered down to classroom level, for example an exploration of the meaning of symbols used in the Gospels.; Our hope is that this first-hand experience of higher education translates into many of these pupils considering university as an option for them.; Durham University library's learning team has devised a colourful programme of events that bring the Gospels to life. Since the start of the school year, they have been delivering a range of workshops for children as young as three right through to pupils of secondary school age, using games, crafts and stories. Over the course of the programmes, we hope to have engaged 15,000 children.; The preparation involved collaboration with schools and museums to identify potential crossover between the exhibition and the national curriculum. From puppet-making to carpet page bingo, the team created activities to underpin the key Gospel themes within a range of subject areas, spanning the arts, sciences and humanities.; Children have been dressing up in monks' habits and learning how the Lindisfarne monks would have lived; they have been writing with quills to better appreciate the patience and precision needed to create the work of art. There is genuine amazement when they discover the Gospels are made from calf skin and that around 150 cows would have been needed to create the book. The close proximity of St Cuthbert's shrine in Durham Cathedral helps the children to feel more of an affinity with the book.; It's easy to feel far-removed from the Viking attacks on Lindisfarne in 793, but colleagues encourage children to use words and emotions to describe how the monks would have felt about fleeing from their home. The team then link this to the present day by comparing the plight of the Lindisfarne monks with a modern day refugee's experience of being driven away from home. The university sought advice from the education team at the UN Refugee Agency on incorporating real refugee stories into the session to develop a high quality citizenship resource.; The team limits their teaching to the significance of the book as a cultural object rather than dwelling on the religious messages of the Gospels, recognising that there is a clear line between evangelism and education. The classroom sessions are as inclusive as possible, connecting people and enabling them to learn more about their heritage.; Through doing this outreach activity, the team has learnt some valuable lessons that may be useful to other universities embarking on similar programmes:; \u2022 Do not be tied to your ideas. They may look great on paper and they may meet all your learning outcomes, but be open to what works well with children and let this inform what you do.; \u2022 Be imaginative. One Anglo-Saxon manuscript has produced workshops that include elements of history, religious education, science, design and technology, art and citizenship. The key is to make sure it is enjoyable, informative and tied to the national curriculum.; \u2022 Trust your team. They're the ones at the 'chalk face' and know what works, so let them develop and change workshops in response to their experiences.; \u2022 There's no such thing as being over-prepared. No matter how much you do, there will always be something (usually a question from a child) that you have not considered.; \u2022 Collaborate. Take the opportunity to further develop genuine partnerships with schools in the area.; The schools programme is not just a short-term event to coincide with the arrival of the manuscript; it is now embedded in the curriculum which means that the story of the Lindisfarne Gospels \u2013 which helped to shape the North of England and indeed the UK and beyond \u2013 will form part of our children's education, long after the exhibition finishes.; I believe that, through schemes like this, universities can influence the content of classroom teaching to enhance knowledge and make higher education accessible.; Professor Chris Higgins is vice-chancellor at Durham University \u2013 the Lindisfarne Gospels will be exhibited at the university's Palace Green Library from 1 July \u2013 30 September 2013; This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.
